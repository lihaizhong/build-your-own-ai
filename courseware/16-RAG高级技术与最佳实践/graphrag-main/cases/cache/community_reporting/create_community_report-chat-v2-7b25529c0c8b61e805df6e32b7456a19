He served as a deputy commander and was known for devising plans to counter the strategies of Zhuge Liang, a key figure from Shu. Throughout his career, 郭淮 reported on the movements of the Shu army and contributed to the defense strategies under the command of 司马懿, advising him on military operations.\n\n郭淮 played a crucial role in the siege of 卤城 and was actively engaged in military discussions aimed at countering Shu Han's forces. He was also involved in the defense against the forces led by 孔明 and was tasked with leading troops at 陇西. Additionally, 郭淮 opposed the rebellion led by 夏侯霸 and fought against him, showcasing his commitment to maintaining stability within the Wei state.\n\nDespite his military prowess, 郭淮 ultimately met his demise during a battle at 铁笼山, where he was killed by 姜维, a general from Shu.

To resolve this contradiction, it is clear that孙礼 is primarily a general of the Wei state, actively engaged in military efforts against Shu, and any references to him being associated with Shu are likely erroneous or misattributed.
