{"result": "Meng Da (孟达) is a notable military officer and general from the Three Kingdoms period, primarily associated with the Shu Han state before his defection to Wei. He played a significant role in various military conflicts and strategies during this tumultuous era. Initially serving under Liu Bei, Meng Da was involved in the administration of Shu Han and was known for his close relationship with 彭羕 and his alliance with 法正, sharing a common hometown with the latter.\n\nMeng Da's military career included advising 刘封, which ultimately led to 刘封's failure to save his uncle, and he was also involved in the capture of 定军山 following 黄忠's victory. However, his actions were not without controversy; he is suspected of plotting a rebellion against the Wei state and did not provide critical assistance to 关公 (Guan Yu) when it was most needed. His military prowess was recognized, but he faced significant challenges, including being captured by 司马懿 in a previous campaign.\n\nDespite his initial loyalty to Shu Han, Meng Da's later surrender to Cao Wei marked a turning point in his career. His involvement in military strategies and actions ultimately led to his downfall, as he was killed in battle. Meng Da's legacy is characterized by his complex relationships with other military leaders and his pivotal role in the shifting allegiances of the Three Kingdoms period.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
