{"result": "Cao Hong and Zhang He are involved in a complex relationship marked by both conflict and concern. Initially, Cao Hong expresses anger towards Zhang He due to his actions, going so far as to order his execution, which highlights a significant rift between them. However, this animosity is tempered by Cao Hong's concern for Zhang He's performance in battle, as he seeks to provide assistance to improve his effectiveness.
