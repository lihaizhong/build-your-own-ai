{"result": "Cao Cao and Guan Gong share a complex relationship characterized by both mutual respect and underlying tension. Cao Cao expresses joy and appreciation for Guan Gong's victory over Hua Xiong, recognizing his martial prowess. However, he is also aware of Guan Gong's potential as a threat due to his loyalty to Liu Bei and his growing military successes, which concern Cao Cao and indicate a rivalry between them. Despite serving under Cao Cao, Guan Gong remains loyal to Liu Bei, leading to conflicts that represent the opposing forces during the Three Kingdoms period. Additionally, Guan Gong is currently on a mission that opposes Cao Cao's interests, as he seeks to find his brother in Hebei.
