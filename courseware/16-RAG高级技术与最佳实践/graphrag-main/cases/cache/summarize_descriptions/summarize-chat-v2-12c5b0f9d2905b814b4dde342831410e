His reign was marked by significant political turmoil and instability, as he continued the trend of eunuch dominance that began during the reign of Emperor Huan. This concentration of power in the hands of eunuchs led to further unrest within the state. 灵帝's decisions and authority were heavily influenced by court officials, and he was succeeded by his son, 皇子辩.
