{"result": "Yang Yi is a high-ranking official in the Shu Han kingdom, recognized for his long history of service as a military officer. He was initially tasked with leading the army and held important responsibilities following the death of the renowned strategist Kong Ming (Zhuge Liang). Despite his significant role, Yang Yi is perceived as subordinate to Wei Yan, another prominent military leader. His loyalty to the Shu Han kingdom is called into question when he is accused of rebellion against the Emperor, which complicates his standing within the court.
