{"result": "The entity \"玉玺\" (Yuxi), also known as the imperial seal, is a significant symbol of authority and legitimacy in ancient China. Historically, it has been passed down through various dynasties and is deeply intertwined with the power struggles of the time. The imperial seal is contested during these power struggles, as different factions seek to legitimize their claims to the throne. \n\nNotably, the 玉玺 was left by Sun Jian and later offered by his son, Sun Ce, as collateral to borrow troops from Yuan Shu for a military campaign. This act underscores the seal's importance not only as a symbol of authority but also as a practical tool in political maneuvering. Additionally, 袁术 (Yuan Shu) sought to use the 玉玺 to bolster his own claim to imperial power, further illustrating its role in the dynamics of legitimacy and authority. The seal is also presented during significant ceremonies, such as the 大礼 (Dali), to affirm the legitimacy of the 汉中王 (Han Zhongwang). Overall, the 玉玺 serves as a powerful emblem of imperial authority throughout Chinese history.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
