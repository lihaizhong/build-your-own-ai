{"result": "孙礼 is a general in the Wei state, recognized for his involvement in military operations against the Shu forces. He is known for his military tactics and collaborates with 郭淮 in strategizing against the Shu army. As a military officer, he proposed a tactical plan that involved deception and ambush to counter the Shu Han. Additionally, he reported to the Wei emperor about the situation with the Shu army at 祁山. \n\nHowever, there are conflicting descriptions regarding his allegiance, as some state that he is a general of the Shu state who was injured in battle and managed to break through enemy lines, while others assert that he is firmly aligned with the Wei state. To resolve this contradiction, it is clear that孙礼 is primarily a general of the Wei state, actively engaged in military efforts against Shu, and any references to him being associated with Shu are likely erroneous or misattributed. Thus, the comprehensive summary confirms that 孙礼 is a key military figure in the Wei state, focused on combating the Shu forces.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
