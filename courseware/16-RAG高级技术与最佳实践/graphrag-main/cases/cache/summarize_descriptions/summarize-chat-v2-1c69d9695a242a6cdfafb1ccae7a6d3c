{"result": "乐綝 is a multifaceted figure in the historical context of the Three Kingdoms period, known for his military and political roles across different states. He served as a general in the Wei army, where he played a significant part in the capture of 公孙渊 and supported 司马懿 in military campaigns against the Shu state. His contributions in these conflicts highlight his strategic importance within the Wei forces.\n\nIn addition to his military endeavors, 乐綝 also held a position as a governor in the Yangzhou region, where he was involved in political intrigues, particularly against 诸葛诞. His influence extended into the Eastern Wu territory, where he was recognized as a powerful official known for his violent nature, especially after the death of Sun Jun, during which he took control of the government.\n\nInterestingly, there are conflicting accounts regarding his allegiance and actions. While he is noted as a general in the Wei army, there are also descriptions that suggest he was a general for the Shu state, where he, alongside 张虎, managed to break through enemy lines and return to their base. This duality in his roles reflects the complex and often shifting allegiances during this tumultuous period in Chinese history. Overall, 乐綝 is depicted as a significant military leader and political player whose actions had a lasting impact on the dynamics of power among the Three Kingdoms.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
