{"result": "郿坞 is a significant location associated with the events surrounding the downfall of Dong Zhuo, a prominent figure in Chinese history. It is noted for being the site of crucial military actions and political maneuvers aimed at opposing Dong Zhuo's rule. The location is particularly important in the narrative as it is where Dong Zhuo plans to take the character 貂蝉, highlighting its role in the unfolding story. Additionally, 郿坞 serves as a command center for Dong Zhuo, where he directs his troops and strategizes his return to the capital. Ultimately, it is also the final resting place of Dong Zhuo, as his remains were buried there following several failed attempts to secure a more suitable burial site. This multifaceted significance of 郿坞 underscores its importance in the historical and narrative context surrounding Dong Zhuo's legacy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
