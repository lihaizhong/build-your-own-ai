{"result": "The entity \"庞统\" (Pang Tong) is noted for his strategic capabilities, which were recognized by \"鲁肃\" (Lu Su), who recommended him to \"孙权\" (Sun Quan). This recommendation highlights a professional relationship between Pang Tong and Lu Su, as well as an acknowledgment of Pang Tong's abilities within the military strategies employed by Sun Quan. However, despite being summoned by Sun Quan, Pang Tong ultimately faced dissatisfaction from Sun Quan, which resulted in him not being utilized effectively in military matters.
