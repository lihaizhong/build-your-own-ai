{"result": "Xuchang (许昌) is a historically significant city in China, particularly during the Three Kingdoms period. It served as the capital of the Wei state and was a central hub for political and military activities. The city was the base of the warlord Cao Cao, who made critical political and military decisions there. Xuchang was also the site where Sima Yi met with the Wei ruler, highlighting its importance in the political landscape of the time.\n\nIn the context of the narrative, Xuchang is depicted as a location where various political actions and alliances are negotiated. It is also significant for the character Xu Shu (徐庶), who travels to the city to visit his mother, who is imprisoned by Cao Cao. This personal storyline adds depth to the city's role in the broader conflict.\n\nAdditionally, Xuchang is portrayed as a strategic location for Cao Cao, who considers retreating there if he cannot hold the critical battle at Guandu (官渡).
