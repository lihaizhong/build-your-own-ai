贺已毕，命收拾美玉明珠等物，遣人赍进谢恩。早有细作报说蜀主引本国大兵，及蛮王沙摩柯番兵数万，又有洞溪汉将杜路、刘宁二枝兵，水陆并进，声势震天。水路军已出巫口，旱路军已到秭归。时孙权虽登王位，奈魏主不肯接应，乃问文武曰：“蜀兵势大，当复如何？”众皆默然。权叹曰：“周郎之后有鲁肃，鲁肃之后有吕蒙，今吕蒙已亡，无人与孤分忧也！”言未毕，忽班部中一少年将，奋然而出，伏地奏曰：“臣虽年幼，颇习兵书。愿乞数万之兵，以破蜀兵。”权视之，乃孙桓也。桓字叔武，其父名河，本姓俞氏，孙策爱之，赐姓孙，因此亦系吴王宗族。河生四子，桓居其长，弓马熟娴，常从吴王征讨，累立奇功，官授武卫都尉；时年二十五岁。权曰：“汝有何策胜之？”桓曰：“臣有大将二员：一名李异，一名谢旌，俱有万夫不当之勇。乞数万之众，往擒刘备。”权曰：“侄虽英勇，争奈年幼；必得一人相助，方可。”虎威将军朱然出曰：“臣愿与小将军同擒刘备。”权许之，遂点水陆军五万，封孙桓为左都督，朱然为右都督，即日起兵。哨马探得蜀兵已至宜都下寨，孙桓引二万五千军马，屯于宜都界口，前后分作三营，以拒蜀兵。却说蜀将吴班领先锋之印，自出川以来，所到之处，望风而降，兵不血刃，直到宜都；探知孙桓在彼下寨，飞奏先主。时先主已到秭归，闻奏怒曰：“量此小儿，安敢与朕抗耶！”关兴奏曰：“既孙权令此子为将，不劳陛下遣大将，臣愿往擒之。”先主曰：“朕正欲观汝壮气。”即命关兴前往。兴拜辞欲行，张苞出曰：“既关兴前去讨贼，臣愿同行。”先主曰：“二侄同行甚妙，但须谨慎，不可造次。”  \n  \n  　　二人拜辞先主，会合先锋，一同进兵，列成阵势。孙桓听知蜀兵大至，合寨多起。两阵对圆，桓领李异、谢旌立马于门旗之下，见蜀营中，拥出二员大将，皆银盔银铠，白马白旗：上首张苞挺丈八点钢矛，下首关兴横着大砍刀。苞大骂曰：“孙桓竖子！死在临时，尚敢抗拒天兵乎！”桓亦骂曰：“汝父已作无头之鬼；今汝又来讨死，好生不智！”张苞大怒，挺枪直取孙桓。桓背后谢旌，骤马来迎。两将战有三十余合，旌败走，苞乘胜赶来。李\n######################\nOutput:"},
