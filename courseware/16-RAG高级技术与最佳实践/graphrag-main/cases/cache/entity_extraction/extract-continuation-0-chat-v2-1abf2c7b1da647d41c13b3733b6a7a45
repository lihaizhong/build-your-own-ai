玄德，言：“来日吴侯、国太亲自要见，好生在意！”玄德与孙乾、赵云商议。云曰：“来日此会，多凶少吉，云自引五百军保护。”次日，吴国太、乔国老先在甘露寺方丈里坐定。孙权引一班谋士，随后都到，却教吕范来馆驿中请玄德。玄德内披细铠，外穿棉袍，从人背剑紧随，上马投甘露寺来。赵云全装惯带，引五百军随行。来到寺前下马，先见孙权。权观玄德仪表非凡，心中有畏惧之意。二人叙礼毕，遂入方丈见国太。国太见了玄德，大喜，谓乔国老曰：“真吾婿也！”国老曰：“玄德有龙凤之姿，天日之表；更兼仁德布于天下：国太得此佳婿，真可庆也！”玄德拜谢，共宴于方丈之中。少刻，子龙带剑而入，立于玄德之侧。国太问曰：“此是何人？”玄德答曰：“常山赵子龙也。”国太曰：“莫非当阳长坂抱阿斗者乎？”玄德曰：“然。”国太曰：“真将军也！”遂赐以酒。赵云谓玄德曰：“却才某于廊下巡视，见房内有刀斧手埋伏，必无好意。可告知国太。”玄德乃跪于国太席前，泣而告曰：“若杀刘备，就此请诛。”国太曰：“何出此言？”玄德曰：“廊下暗伏刀斧手，非杀备而何？”国太大怒，责骂孙权：“今日玄德既为我婿，即我之儿女也。何故伏刀斧手于廊下！”权推不知，唤吕范问之；范推贾华；国太唤贾华责骂，华默然无言。国太喝令斩之。玄德告曰：“若斩大将，于亲不利，备难久居膝下矣。”乔国老也相劝。国太方叱退贾华。刀斧手皆抱头鼠窜而去。\n玄德更衣出殿前，见庭下有一石块。玄德拔从者所佩之剑，仰天祝曰：“若刘备能勾回荆州，成王霸之业，一剑挥石为两段。如死于此地，剑剁石不开。”言讫，手起剑落，火光迸溅，砍石为两段。孙权在后面看见，问曰：“玄德公如何恨此石？”玄德曰：“备年近五旬，不能为国家剿除贼党，心常自恨。今蒙国太招为女婿，此平生之际遇也。恰才问天买卦，如破曹兴汉，砍断此石。今果然如此。”权暗思：“刘备莫非用此言瞒我？”亦掣剑谓玄德曰：“吾亦问天买卦。若破得曹贼，亦断此石。”却暗暗祝告曰：“若再取得荆州，兴旺东吴，砍石为两半！”手起剑落，巨石亦开。至今有十字纹“恨石”尚存。后人观此胜迹，作诗赞曰：“宝剑落时山石断，金环响处火光生，\n######################\nOutput:"},
