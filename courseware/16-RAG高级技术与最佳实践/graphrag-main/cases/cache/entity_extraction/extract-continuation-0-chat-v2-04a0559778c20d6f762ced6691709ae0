孔明二气周公瑾\n\n却说玄德见孙夫人房中两边枪刀森列，侍婢皆佩剑，不觉失色。管家婆进曰：“贵人休得惊惧：夫人自幼好观武事，居常令侍婢击剑为乐，故尔如此。”玄德曰：“非夫人所观之事，吾甚心寒，可命暂去。”管家婆禀覆孙夫人曰：“房中摆列兵器，娇客不安，今且去之。”孙夫人笑曰：“厮杀半生，尚惧兵器乎！”命尽撤去，令侍婢解剑伏侍。当夜玄德与孙夫人成亲，两情欢洽。玄德又将金帛散给侍婢，以买其心，先教孙乾回荆州报喜。自此连日饮酒。国太十分爱敬。\n却说孙权差人来柴桑郡报周瑜，说：“我母亲力主，已将吾妹嫁刘备。不想弄假成真。此事还复如何？”瑜闻大惊，行坐不安，乃思一计，修密书付来人持回见孙权。权拆书视之。书略曰：“瑜所谋之事，不想反覆如此。既已弄假成真，又当就此用计。刘备以枭雄之姿，有关、张、赵云之将，更兼诸葛用谋，必非久屈人下者。愚意莫如软困之于吴中：盛为筑宫室，以丧其心志；多送美色玩好，以娱其耳目；使分开关、张之情，隔远诸葛之契，各置一方，然后以兵击之，大事可定矣。今若纵之，恐蛟龙得云雨，终非池中物也。愿明公熟思之。”孙权看毕，以书示张昭。昭曰：“公瑾之谋，正合愚意。刘备起身微末，奔走天下，未尝受享富贵。今若以华堂大厦，子女金帛，令彼享用，自然疏远孔明、关、张等，使彼各生怨望，然后荆州可图也。主公可依公瑾之计而速行之。”权大喜，即日修整东府，广栽花木，盛设器用，请玄德与妹居住；又增女乐数十余人，并金玉锦绮玩好之物。国太只道孙权好意，喜不自胜。玄德果然被声色所迷，全不想回荆州。\n却说赵云与五百军在东府前住，终日无事，只去城外射箭走马。看看年终。云猛省：“孔明分付三个锦囊与我，教我一到南徐，开第一个；住到年终，开第二个；临到危急无路之时，开第三个：于内有神出鬼没之计，可保主公回家。此时岁已将终，主公贪恋女色，并不见面，何不拆开第二个锦囊，看计而行？”遂拆开视之。原来如此神策。即日径到府堂，要见玄德。侍婢报曰：“赵子龙有紧急事来报贵人。”玄德唤入问之。云佯作失惊之状曰：“主公深居画堂，不想荆州耶？”玄德曰：“有甚事如此惊怪？”云曰：“今�\n######################\nOutput:"},
