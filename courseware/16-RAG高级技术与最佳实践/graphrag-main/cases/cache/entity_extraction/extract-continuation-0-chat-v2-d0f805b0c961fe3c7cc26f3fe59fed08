　　却说邓艾在陇西，既受伐蜀之诏，一面令司马望往遏羌人，又遣雍州刺史诸葛绪，天水太守王颀，陇西太守牵弘，金城太守杨欣，各调本部兵前来听令。比及军马云集，邓艾夜作一梦：梦见登高山，望汉中，忽于脚下迸出一泉，水势上涌。须臾惊觉，浑身汗流；遂坐而待旦，乃召护卫爰邵问之。邵素明《周易》，艾备言其梦，邵答曰：“《易》云：山上有水曰蹇。蹇卦者：‘利西南，不利东北。’孔子云：‘蹇利西南，往有功也；不利东北，其道穷也。’将军此行，必然克蜀；但可惜蹇滞不能还。”艾闻言，愀然不乐。忽钟会檄文至，约艾起兵，于汉中取齐。艾遂遣雍州刺史诸葛绪，引兵一万五千，先断姜维归路；次遣天水太守王颀，引兵一万五千，从左攻沓中；陇西太守牵弘，引一万五千人，从右攻沓中；又遣金城太守杨欣，引一万五千人，于甘松邀姜维之后。艾自引兵三万，往来接应。却说钟会出师之时，有百官送出城外，旌旗蔽日，铠甲凝霜，人强马壮，威风凛然。人皆称羡，惟有相国参军刘寔，微笑不语。太尉王祥见寔冷笑，就马上握其手而问曰：“钟、邓二人，此去可平蜀乎？”寔曰：“破蜀必矣。但恐皆不得还都耳。”王祥问其故，刘寔但笑而不答。祥遂不复问。

　　却说魏兵既发，早有细作入沓中报知姜维。维即具表申奏后主：“请降诏遣左车骑将军张翼领兵守护阳安关，右车骑将军廖化领兵守阴平桥：这二处最为要紧，若失二处，汉中不保矣。一面当遣使入吴求救。臣一面自起沓中之兵拒敌。”时后主改景耀六年为炎兴元年，日与宦官黄皓在宫中游乐。忽接姜维之表，即召黄皓问曰：“今魏国遣钟会、邓艾大起人马，分道而来，如之奈何？”皓奏曰：“此乃姜维欲立功名，故上此表。陛下宽心，勿生疑虑。臣闻城中有一师婆，供奉一神，能知吉凶，可召来问之。”后主从其言，于后殿陈设香花纸烛、享祭礼物，令黄皓用小车请入宫\n######################\nOutput:"},
