　　钟会与昭曰：“今孙綝退去，外无救兵，城可围矣。”昭从之，遂催军攻围。全祎引兵欲入寿春，见魏兵势大，寻思进退无路，遂降司马昭。昭加祎为偏将军。祎感昭恩德，乃修家书与父全端，叔全怿，言孙綝不仁，不若降魏，将书射入城中。怿得祎书，遂与端引数千人开门出降。诸葛诞在城中忧闷，谋士蒋班、焦彝进言曰：“城中粮少兵多，不能久守，可率吴、楚之众，与魏兵决一死战。”诞大怒曰：“吾欲守，汝欲战，莫非有异心乎！再言必斩！”二人仰天长叹曰：“诞将亡矣！我等不如早降，免至一死！”是夜二更时分，蒋、焦二人逾城降魏，司马昭重用之。因此城中虽有敢战之士，不敢言战。诞在城中，见魏兵四下筑起土城以防淮水，只望水泛，冲倒土城，驱兵击之。不想自秋至冬，并无霖雨，淮水不泛。城中看看粮尽，文钦在小城内与二子坚守，见军士渐渐饿倒，只得来告诞曰：“粮皆尽绝，军士饿损，不如将北方之兵尽放出城，以省其食。”诞大怒曰：“汝教我尽去北军，欲谋我耶？”叱左右推出斩之。文鸯、文虎见父被杀，各拔短刀，立杀数十人，飞身上城，一跃而下，越壕赴魏寨投降。司马昭恨文鸯昔日单骑退兵之仇，欲斩之。钟会谏曰：“罪在文钦，今文钦已亡，二子势穷来归，若杀降将，是坚城内人之心也。”昭从之，遂召文鸯、文虎入帐，用好言抚慰，赐骏马锦衣，加为偏将军，封关内侯。\n######################\nOutput:"},
