到本寨，以酒食待之，却细问其故。蛮兵告曰：“前面是金环三结元帅大寨，正在山口。寨边东西两路，却通五溪洞并董荼那、阿会喃各寨之后。”  \n  \n  　　赵云、魏延听知此话，遂点精兵五千，教擒来蛮兵引路。比及起军时，已是二更天气；月明星朗，趁着月色而行。刚到金环三结大寨之时，约有四更，蛮兵方起造饭，准备天明厮杀。忽然赵云、魏延两路杀入，蛮兵大乱。赵云直杀入中军，正逢金环三结元帅；交马只一合，被云一枪刺落马下，就枭其首级。余军溃散。魏延便分兵一半，望东路抄董荼那寨来。赵云分兵一半，望西路抄阿会喃寨来。比及杀到蛮兵大寨之时，天已平明。先说魏延杀奔董荼那寨来。董荼那听知寨后有军杀至，便引兵出寨拒敌。忽然寨前门一声喊起，蛮兵大乱。原来王平军马早已到了。两下夹攻，蛮兵大败。董荼那夺路走脱，魏延追赶不上。却说赵云引兵杀到阿会喃寨后之时，马忠已杀至寨前。两下夹攻，蛮兵大败，阿会喃乘乱走脱。各自收军，回见孔明。孔明问曰：“三洞蛮兵，走了两洞之主；金环三结元帅首级安在？”赵云将首级献功。众皆言曰：“董荼那、阿会喃皆弃马越岭而去，因此赶他不上。”孔明大笑曰：“二人吾已擒下了。”赵、魏二人并诸将皆不信。少顷，张嶷解董荼那到，张翼解阿会喃到。众皆惊讶。孔明曰：“吾观吕凯图本，已知他各人下的寨子，故以言激子龙、文长之锐气，故教深入重地，先破金环三结，随即分兵左右寨后抄出，以王平、马忠应之。非子龙、文长不可当此任也。吾料董荼那、阿会喃必从便径往山路而走，故遣张嶷、张翼以伏兵待之，令关索以兵接应，擒此二人。”诸将皆拜伏曰：“丞相机算，神鬼莫测！”  \n  \n  　　孔明令押过董荼那、阿会喃至帐下，尽去其缚，以酒食衣服赐之，令各自归洞，勿得助恶。二人泣拜，各投小路而去。孔明谓诸将曰：“来日孟获必然亲自引兵厮杀，便可就此擒之。”乃唤赵云、魏延至，付与计策，各引五千兵去了。又唤王平、关索同引一军，授计而去。孔明分拨已毕，坐于帐上待之。却说蛮王孟获在帐中正坐，忽哨马报来，说三洞元帅，俱被孔明捉将去了；部下\n######################\nOutput:"},
