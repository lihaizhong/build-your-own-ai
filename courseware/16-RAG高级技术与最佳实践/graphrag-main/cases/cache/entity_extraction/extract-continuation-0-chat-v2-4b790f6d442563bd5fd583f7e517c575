孔明升帐，马岱押过雅丹来。孔明叱武士去其缚，赐酒压惊，用好言抚慰。雅丹深感其德。孔明曰：“吾主乃大汉皇帝，今命吾讨贼，尔如何反助逆？吾今放汝回去，说与汝主：吾国与尔乃邻邦，永结盟好，勿听反贼之言。”遂将所获羌兵及车马器械，尽给还雅丹，俱放回国。众皆拜谢而去。孔明引三军连夜投祁山大寨而来，命关兴、张苞引军先行；一面差人赍表奏报捷音。  \n  \n  　　却说曹真连日望羌人消息，忽有伏路军来报说：“蜀兵拔寨收拾起程。”郭淮大喜曰：“此因羌兵攻击，故尔退去。”遂分两路追赶。前面蜀兵乱走，魏兵随后追袭。先锋曹遵正赶之间，忽然鼓声大震，一彪军闪出，为首大将乃魏延也，大叫曰：“反贼休走！”曹遵大惊，拍马交锋；不三合，被魏延一刀斩于马下。副先锋朱赞引兵追赶，忽然一彪军闪出，为首大将乃赵云也。朱赞措手不及，被云一枪刺死。曹真、郭淮见西路先锋有失，欲收兵回；背后喊声大震，鼓角齐鸣：关兴、张苞两路兵杀出，围了曹真、郭淮，痛杀一阵。曹、郭二人，引败兵冲路走脱。蜀兵全胜，直追到渭水，夺了魏寨。曹真折了两个先锋，哀伤不已；只得写本申朝，乞拨援兵。  \n  \n  　　却说魏主曹睿设朝，近臣奏曰：“大都督曹真，数败于蜀，折了两个先锋，羌兵又折了无数，其势甚急，今上表求救，请陛下裁处。”睿大惊，急问退军之策。华歆奏曰：“须是陛下御驾亲征，大会诸侯，人皆用命，方可退也。不然，长安有失，关中危矣！”太傅钟繇奏曰：“凡为将者，智过于人，则能制人。孙子云：知彼知己，百战百胜。臣量曹真虽久用兵，非诸葛亮对手。臣以全家良贱，保举一人，可退蜀兵。未知圣意准否？”睿曰：“卿乃大老元臣，有何贤士，可退蜀兵，早召来与朕分忧。”钟繇奏曰：“向者，诸葛亮欲兴师犯境，但惧此人，故散流言，使陛下疑而去之，方敢长驱大进。今若复用之，则亮自退矣。”睿问何人。繇曰：“骠骑大将军司马懿也。”睿叹曰：“此事朕亦悔之。今仲达现在何地？”繇曰：“近闻仲达在宛城闲住。”睿即降诏，遣使持节，复司马懿官职，加为平西都督，就起南阳诸路军马，前赴长安。睿御驾亲征，令\n######################\nOutput:"},
