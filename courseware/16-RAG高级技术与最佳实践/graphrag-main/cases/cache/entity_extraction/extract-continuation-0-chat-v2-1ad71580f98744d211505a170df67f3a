守洮阳，故径取洮阳；如得此城，屯粮积草，结连羌人，以图久计耳。”望曰：“若此，如之奈何？”艾曰：“可尽撤此处之兵，分为两路去救洮阳。离洮阳二十五里，有侯河小城，乃洮阳咽喉之地。公引一军伏于洮阳，偃旗息鼓，大开四门，如此如此而行；我却引一军伏侯河，必获大胜也。”筹画已定，各各依计而行。只留偏将师纂守祁山寨。  \n  \n  　　却说姜维令夏侯霸为前部，先引一军径取洮阳。霸提兵前进，将近洮阳，望见城上并无一杆旌旗，四门大开。霸心下疑惑，未敢入城，回顾诸将曰：“莫非诈乎？”诸将曰：“眼见得是空城，只有些小百姓，听知大将军兵到，尽弃城而走了。”霸未信，自纵马于城南视之，只见城后老小无数，皆望西北而逃。霸大喜曰：“果空城也。”遂当先杀入，余众随后而进。方到瓮城边，忽然一声炮响，城上鼓角齐鸣，旌旗遍竖，拽起吊桥。霸大惊曰：“误中计矣！”慌欲退时，城上矢石如雨。可怜夏侯霸同五百军，皆死于城下。后人有诗叹曰：“大胆姜维妙算长，谁知邓艾暗提防。可怜投汉夏侯霸，顷刻城边箭下亡。”司马望从城内杀出，蜀兵大败而逃。随后姜维引接应兵到，杀退司马望，就傍城下寨。维闻夏侯霸射死，嗟伤不已。是夜二更，邓艾自侯河城内，暗引一军潜地杀入蜀寨。蜀兵大乱，姜维禁止不住。城上鼓角喧天，司马望引兵杀出。两下夹攻，蜀兵大败。维左冲右突，死战得脱，退二十余里下寨。蜀兵两番败走之后，心中摇动。维与众将曰：“胜败乃兵家之常，今虽损兵折将，不足为忧。成败之事，在此一举，汝等始终勿改。如有言退者立斩。”张翼进言曰：“魏兵皆在此处，祁山必然空虚。将军整兵与邓艾交锋，攻打洮阳、侯河；某引一军取祁山。取了祁山九寨，便驱兵向长安。此为上计。”维从之，即令张翼引后军径取祁山。
