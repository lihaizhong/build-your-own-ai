日饮酒，使者回报玄德。玄德大惊，忙来问孔明。孔明笑曰：“原来如此！军前恐无好酒；成都佳酿极多，可将五十瓮作三车装，送到军前与张将军饮。”玄德曰：“吾弟自来饮酒失事，军师何故反送酒与他？”孔明笑曰：“主公与翼德做了许多年兄弟，还不知其为人耶？翼德自来刚强，然前于收川之时，义释严颜，此非勇夫所为也。今与张郃相拒五十余日，酒醉之后，便坐山前辱骂，傍若无人：此非贪杯，乃败张郃之计耳。”玄德曰：“虽然如此，未可托大。可使魏延助之。”孔明令魏延解酒赴军前，车上各插黄旗，大书“军前公用美酒”。魏延领命，解酒到寨中，见张飞，传说主公赐酒。飞拜受讫，分付魏延、雷铜各引一枝人马，为左右翼；只看军中红旗起，便各进兵；教将酒摆列帐下，令军士大开旗鼓而饮。有细作报上山来，张郃自来山顶观望，见张飞坐于帐下饮酒，令二小卒于面前相扑为戏。郃曰：“张飞欺我太甚！”传令今夜下山劫飞寨，令蒙头、荡石二寨，皆出为左右援。当夜张郃乘着月色微明，引军从山侧而下，径到寨前。遥望张飞大明灯烛，正在帐中饮酒。张郃当先大喊一声，山头擂鼓为助，直杀入中军。但见张飞端坐不动。张郃骤马到面前，一枪刺倒，却是一个草人。急勒马回时，帐后连珠炮起。一将当先，拦住去路，睁圆环眼，声如巨雷：乃张飞也。挺矛跃马，直取张郃。两将在火光中，战到三五十合。张郃只盼两寨来救，谁知两寨救兵，已被魏延，雷铜两将杀退，就势夺了二寨。张郃不见救兵至，正没奈何，又见山上火起，已被张飞后军夺了寨栅。张郃三寨俱失，只得奔瓦口关去了。张飞大获胜捷，报入成都。玄德大喜，方知翼德饮酒是计，只要诱张郃下山。却说张郃退守瓦口关，三万军已折了二万，遣人问曹洪求救。洪大怒曰：“汝不听吾言，强要进兵，失了紧要隘口，却又来求救！”遂不肯发兵，使人催督张郃出战。郃心慌，只得定计，分两军去关口前山僻埋伏，分付曰：“我诈败，张飞必然赶来，汝等就截其归路。”当日张郃引军前进，正遇雷铜。战不数合，张郃败走，雷铜赶来。西军齐出，截断回路。张郃复回，刺雷铜于马下。败军回报张飞，飞自来与张郃挑战。郃又诈\n######################\nOutput:"},
