尊父也。昔自出茅庐，一言已分三国，扫平荆、益，遂成霸业，古今鲜有及者；后六出祁山，非其智力不足，乃天数耳。今后主昏弱，王气已终，艾奉天子之命，以重兵伐蜀，已皆得其地矣。成都危在旦夕，公何不应天顺人，仗义来归？艾当表公为琅琊王，以光耀祖宗，决不虚言。幸存照鉴。”瞻看毕，勃然大怒，扯碎其书，叱武士立斩来使，令从者持首级回魏营见邓艾。艾大怒，即欲出战。丘本谏曰：“将军不可轻出，当用奇兵胜之。”艾从其言，遂令天水太守王颀、陇西太守牵弘，伏两军于后，艾自引兵而来。此时诸葛瞻正欲搦战，忽报邓艾自引兵到。瞻大怒，即引兵出，径杀入魏阵中。邓艾败走，瞻随后掩杀将来。忽然两下伏兵杀出。蜀兵大败，退入绵竹。艾令围之。于是魏兵一齐呐喊，将绵竹围的铁桶相似。诸葛瞻在城中，见事势已迫，乃令彭和赍书杀出，往东吴求救。和至东吴，见了吴主孙休，呈上告急之书。吴主看罢，与群臣计议曰：“既蜀中危急，孤岂可坐视不救。”即令考将丁奉为主帅，丁封、孙异为副将，率兵五万，前往救蜀。丁奉领旨出师，分拨丁封、孙异引兵二万向沔中而进，自率兵三万向寿春而进：分兵三路来援。  \n  \n  　　却说诸葛瞻见救兵不至，谓众将曰：“久守非良图。”遂留子尚与尚书张遵守城，瞻自披挂上马，引三军大开三门杀出。邓艾见兵出，便撤兵退。瞻奋力追杀，忽然一声炮响，四面兵合，把瞻困在垓心。瞻引兵左冲右突，杀死数百人。艾令众军放箭射之，蜀兵四散。瞻中箭落马，乃大呼曰：“吾力竭矣，当以一死报国！”遂拔剑自刎而死。其子诸葛尚在城上，见父死于军中，勃然大怒，遂披挂上马。张遵谏曰：“小将军勿得轻出。”尚叹曰：“吾父子祖孙，荷国厚恩，今父既死于敌，我何用生为！”遂策马杀出，死于阵中。后人有诗赞瞻、尚父子曰：“不是忠臣独少谋，苍天有意绝炎刘。当年诸葛留嘉胤，节义真堪继武侯。”邓艾怜其忠，将父子合葬。乘虚攻打绵竹。张遵、黄崇、李球三人，各引一军杀出。蜀兵寡，魏兵众，三人亦皆战死。艾因此得了绵竹。劳�\n######################\nOutput:"},
