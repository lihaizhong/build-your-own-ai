了来使，遂起部下兵千人，杀奔扬州来。将至南门，城门已闭，吊桥拽起。诞在城下叫门，城上并无一人回答。诞大怒曰：“乐綝匹夫，安敢如此！”遂令将士打城。手下十余骁骑，下马渡壕，飞身上城，杀散军士，大开城门，于是诸葛诞引兵入城，乘风放火，杀至綝家。綝慌上楼避之。诞提剑上楼，大喝曰：“汝父乐进，昔日受魏国大恩！不思报本，反欲顺司马昭耶！”綝未及回言，为诞所杀。一面具表数司马昭之罪，使人申奏洛阳；一面大聚两淮屯田户口十余万，并扬州新降兵四万余人，积草屯粮，准备进兵；又令长史吴纲，送子诸葛靓入吴为质求援，务要合兵诛讨司马昭。  \n  \n  　　此时东吴丞相孙峻病亡，从弟孙綝辅政。綝字子通，为人强暴，杀大司马滕胤、将军吕据、王惇等，因此权柄皆归于綝。吴主孙亮，虽然聪明，无可奈何。于是吴纲将诸葛靓至石头城，入拜孙綝。綝问其故，纲曰：“诸葛诞乃蜀汉诸葛武侯之族弟也，向事魏国；今见司马昭欺君罔上，废主弄权，欲兴师讨之，而力不及，故特来归降。诚恐无凭，专送亲子诸葛靓为质。伏望发兵相助。”綝从其请，便遣大将全怿、全端为主将，于诠为合后，朱异、唐咨为先锋，文钦为向导，起兵七万，分三队而进。吴纲回寿春报知诸葛诞。诞大喜，遂陈兵准备。却说诸葛诞表文到洛阳，司马昭见了大怒，欲自往讨之。贾充谏曰：“主公乘父兄之基业，恩德未及四海，今弃天子而去，若一朝有变，悔之何及？不如奏请太后及天子一同出征，可保无虞。”昭喜曰：“此言正合吾意。”遂入奏太后曰：“诸葛诞谋反，臣与文武官僚，计议停当：请太后同天子御驾亲征，以继先帝之遗意。”太后畏惧，只得从之。次日，昭请魏主曹髦起程。髦曰：“大将军都督天下军马，任从调遣，何必朕自行也？”昭曰：“不然。昔日武祖纵横四海，文帝、明帝有包括宇宙之志，并吞八荒之心，凡遇大敌，必须自行。陛下正宜追配先君，扫清故孽。何自畏也？”髦畏威权，只得从之。昭遂下诏，尽起两都之兵二十六万，命镇南将军王基为正先锋，安东将军陈骞为副先锋，监军石苞为左军，兖州刺史州泰为右军，保护车驾，浩浩荡荡，杀奔淮南而来。\n######################\nOutput:"},
