里而来，粮草不继，难以持久，粮尽必退；待他退时，然后出奇兵击之，司马懿可擒也。昔司马懿与蜀兵相拒，坚守渭南，孔明竟卒于军中：今日正与此理相同。”二人正商议间，忽报：“魏兵往南去了。”卑衍大惊曰：“彼知吾襄平军少，去袭老营也。若襄平有失，我等守此处无益矣。”遂拔寨随后而起。早有探马飞报司马懿。懿笑曰：“中吾计矣！”乃令夏侯霸、夏侯威，各引一军伏于辽水之滨：“如辽兵到，两下齐出。”二人受计而往。早望见卑衍、杨祚引兵前来。一声炮响，两边鼓噪摇旗：左有夏侯霸、右有夏侯威，一齐杀出。卑、杨二人，无心恋战，夺路而走；奔至首山，正逢公孙渊兵到，合兵一处，回马再与魏兵交战。卑衍出马骂曰：“贼将休使诡计！汝敢出战否？”夏侯霸纵马挥刀来迎。战不数合，被夏侯霸一刀斩卑衍于马下，辽兵大乱。霸驱兵掩杀，公孙渊引败兵奔入襄平城去，闭门坚守不出。魏兵四面围合。  \n  \n  　　时值秋雨连绵，一月不止，平地水深三尺，运粮船自辽河口直至襄平城下。魏兵皆在水中，行坐不安。左都督裴景入帐告曰：“雨水不住，营中泥泞，军不可停，请移于前面山上。”懿怒曰：“捉公孙渊只在旦夕，安可移营？如有再言移营者斩！”裴景喏喏而退。少顷，右都督仇连又来告曰：“军土苦水，乞太尉移营高处。”懿大怒曰：“吾军令已发，汝何敢故违！”即命推出斩之，悬首于辕门外。于是军心震慑。  \n  \n  　　懿令南寨人马暂退二十里，纵城内军民出城樵采柴薪，牧放牛马。司马陈群问曰：“前太尉攻上庸之时，兵分八路，八日赶至城下，遂生擒孟达而成大功；今带甲四万，数千里而来，不令攻打城池，却使久居泥泞之中，又纵贼众樵牧。某实不知太尉是何主意？”懿笑曰：“公不知兵法耶？昔孟达粮多兵少，我粮少兵多，故不可不速战；出其不意，突然攻之，方可取胜。今辽兵多，我兵少，贼饥我饱，何必力攻？正当任彼自走，然后乘机击之。我今放开一条路，不绝彼之樵牧，是容彼自走也。”陈群拜服。
