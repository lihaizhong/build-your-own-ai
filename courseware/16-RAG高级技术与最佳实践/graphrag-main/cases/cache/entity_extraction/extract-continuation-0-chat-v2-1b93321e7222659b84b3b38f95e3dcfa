？当缚耶？”充曰：“司马公有令；只要死的。”成济撚戟直奔辇前。髦大喝曰：“匹夫敢无礼乎！”言未讫，被成济一戟刺中前胸，撞出辇来；再一戟，刃从背上透出，死于辇傍。焦伯挺枪来迎，被成济一戟刺死。众皆逃走。王经随后赶来，大骂贾充曰：“逆贼安敢弑君耶！”充大怒，叱左右缚定，报知司马昭。昭入内，见髦已死，乃佯作大惊之状，以头撞辇而哭，令人报知各大臣。  \n  \n  　　时太傅司马孚入内，见髦尸，首枕其股而哭曰：“弑陛下者，臣之罪也！”遂将髦尸用棺椁盛贮，停于偏殿之西。昭入殿中，召群臣会议。群臣皆至，独有尚书仆射陈泰不至。昭令泰之舅尚书荀顗召之。泰大哭曰：“论者以泰比舅，今舅实不如泰也。”乃披麻带孝而入，哭拜于灵前。昭亦佯哭而问曰：“今日之事，何法处之？”泰曰：“独斩贾充，少可以谢天下耳。”昭沉吟良久，又问曰：“再思其次？”泰曰：“惟有进于此者，不知其次。”昭曰：“成济大逆不道，可剐之，灭其三族。”济大骂昭曰：“非我之罪，是贾充传汝之命！”昭令先割其舌。济至死叫屈不绝。弟成倅亦斩于市，尽灭三族。后人有诗叹曰：“司马当年命贾充，弑君南阙赭袍红。却将成济诛三族，只道军民尽耳聋。”  \n  \n  　　昭又使人收王经全家下狱。王经正在廷尉厅下，忽见缚其母至。经叩头大哭曰：“不孝子累及慈母矣！”母大笑曰：“人谁不死？正恐不得死所耳！以此弃命，何恨之有！”次日，王经全家皆押赴东市。王经母子含笑受刑。满城士庶，无不垂泪。后人有诗曰：“汉初夸伏剑，汉末见王经：真烈心无异，坚刚志更清。节如泰华重，命似鸿毛轻。母子声名在，应同天地倾。”太傅司马孚请以王礼葬曹髦，昭许之。贾充等劝司马昭受魏禅，即天子位。昭曰：昔文王三分天下有其二，以服事殷，故圣人称为至德。魏武帝不肯受禅于汉，犹吾之不肯受禅于魏也。”贾充等闻言，已知司马昭留意于子司马炎矣，遂不复劝进。是年六月，司马昭立常道乡公曹璜为帝，改元景元元年。璜改名曹免，字景明。乃武帝曹操之孙，燕王曹宇之子也。奂封昭为相国、晋公，赐钱十万、绢万匹。其文武多官，各有封赏。早有细作报入\n######################\nOutput:"},
