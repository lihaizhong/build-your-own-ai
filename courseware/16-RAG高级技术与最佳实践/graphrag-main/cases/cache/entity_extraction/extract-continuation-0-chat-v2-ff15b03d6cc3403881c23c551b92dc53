　　当下司马懿、曹爽，扶太子曹芳即皇帝位。芳字兰卿，乃睿乞养之子，秘在宫中，人莫知其所由来。于是曹芳谥睿为明帝，葬于高平陵；尊郭皇后为皇太后；改元正始元年。司马懿与曹爽辅政。爽事懿甚谨，一应大事，必先启知。爽字昭伯，自幼出入宫中，明帝见爽谨慎，甚是爱敬。爽门下有客五百人，内有五人以浮华相尚：一是何晏，字平叔；一是邓飏，字玄茂，乃邓禹之后；一是李胜，字公昭；一是丁谧，字彦靖；一是毕轨，字昭先。又有大司农桓范字元则，颇有智谋，人多称为智囊。此数人皆爽所信任。  \n  \n  　　何晏告爽曰：“主公大权，不可委托他人，恐生后患。爽曰：“司马公与我同受先帝托孤之命，安忍背之？”晏曰：“昔日先公与仲达破蜀兵之时，累受此人之气，因而致死。主公如何不察也？”爽猛然省悟，遂与多官计议停当，入奏魏主曹芳曰：“司马懿功高德重，可加为太傅。”芳从之，自是兵权皆归于爽。爽命弟曹羲为中领军，曹训为武卫将军，曹彦为散骑常侍，各引三千御林军，任其出入禁宫。又用何晏、邓飏、丁谧为尚书，毕轨为司隶校尉，李胜为河南尹：此五人日夜与爽议事。于是曹爽门下宾客日盛。司马懿推病不出，二子亦皆退职闲居。爽每日与何晏等饮酒作乐：凡用衣服器皿，与朝廷无异；各处进贡玩好珍奇之物，先取上等者入己，然后进宫，佳人美女，充满府院。黄门张当，谄事曹爽，私选先帝侍妾七八人，送入府中；爽又选善歌舞良家子女三四十人，为家乐。又建重楼画阁，造金银器皿，用巧匠数百人，昼夜工作。却说何晏闻平原管辂明数术，请与论《易》。时邓飏在座，问辂曰：“君自谓善《易》而语不及《易》中词义，何也？”辂曰：“夫善《易》者，不言《易》也。”晏笑而赞之曰：“可谓要言不烦。”因谓辂曰：“试为我卜一卦：可至三公否？”又问：“连梦青蝇数十，来集鼻上，此是何兆？”辂曰：“元、恺辅舜，周公佐周，皆以和惠谦恭，享有多福。今君侯位尊势重，而怀德者鲜，畏威者众，殆非小心求福之道。且鼻者，山也；山高而不危，所以长守贵也。今青蝇臭恶而集焉。位峻者颠，可不惧乎？愿君侯裒多益寡，非礼勿履：然后三公可至，青蝇可驱也。”\n######################\nOutput:"},
