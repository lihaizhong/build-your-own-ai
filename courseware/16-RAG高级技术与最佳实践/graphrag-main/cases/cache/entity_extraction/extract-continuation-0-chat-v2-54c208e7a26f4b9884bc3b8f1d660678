锁战船北军用武\n\n却说庞统闻言，吃了一惊，急回视其人，原来却是徐庶。统见是故人，心下方定。回顾左右无人，乃曰：“你若说破我计，可惜江南八十一州百姓，皆是你送了也！”庶笑曰：“此间八十三万人马，性命如何？”统曰：“元直真欲破我计耶？”庶曰：“吾感刘皇叔厚恩，未尝忘报。曹操送死吾母，吾已说过终身不设一谋，今安肯破兄良策？只是我亦随军在此，兵败之后，玉石不分，岂能免难？君当教我脱身之术，我即缄口远避矣。”统笑曰：“元直如此高见远识，谅此有何难哉！”庶曰：“愿先生赐教。”统去徐庶耳边略说数句。庶大喜，拜谢。庞统别却徐庶，下船自回江东。\n且说徐庶当晚密使近人去各寨中暗布谣言。次日，寨中三三五五，交头接耳而说。早有探事人报知曹操，说：“军中传言西凉州韩遂、马腾谋反，杀奔许都来。”操大惊，急聚众谋士商议曰：“吾引兵南征，心中所忧者，韩遂、马腾耳。军中谣言，虽未辨虚实，然不可不防。”言未毕，徐庶进曰：“庶蒙丞相收录，恨无寸功报效。请得三千人马，星夜往散关把住隘口；如有紧急，再行告报。”操喜曰：“若得元直去，吾无忧矣！散关之上，亦有军兵，公统领之。目下拨三千马步军，命臧霸为先锋，星夜前去，不可稽迟。”徐庶辞了曹操，与臧霸便行。此便是庞统救徐庶之计。后人有诗曰：“曹操征南日日忧，马腾韩遂起戈矛。凤雏一语教徐庶，正似游鱼脱钓钩。”曹操自遣徐庶去后，心中稍安，遂上马先看沿江旱寨，次看水寨。乘大船一只于中央，上建帅字旗号，两傍皆列水寨，船上埋伏弓弩千张。操居于上。时建安十三年冬十一月十五日，天气晴明，平风静浪。操令：“置酒设乐于大船之上，吾今夕欲会诸将。”天色向晚，东山月上，皎皎如同白日。长江一带，如横素练。操坐大船之上，左右侍御者数百人，皆锦衣绣袄，荷戈执戟。文武众官，各依次而坐。操见南屏山色如画，东视柴桑之境，西观夏口之江，南望樊山，北觑乌林，四顾空阔，心中欢喜，谓众官曰：“吾自\n######################\nOutput:"},
