马，夫人只不肯上马。四边喊声又起。云厉声曰：“夫人不听吾言，追军若至，为之奈何？”糜夫人乃弃阿斗于地，翻身投入枯井中而死。后人有诗赞之曰：“战将全凭马力多，步行怎把幼君扶？拚将一死存刘嗣，勇决还亏女丈夫。”赵云见夫人已死，恐曹军盗尸，便将土墙推倒，掩盖枯井。掩讫，解开勒甲绦，放下掩心镜，将阿斗抱护在怀，绰枪上马。早有一将，引一队步军至，乃曹洪部将晏明也，持三尖两刃刀来战赵云。不三合，被赵云一枪刺倒，杀散众军，冲开一条路。正走间，前面又一枝军马拦路。当先一员大将，旗号分明，大书河间张郃。云更不答话，挺枪便战。约十余合，云不敢恋战，夺路而走。背后张郃赶来，云加鞭而行，不想趷跶一声，连马和人，颠入土坑之内。张郃挺枪来刺，忽然一道红光，从土坑中滚起，那匹马平空一跃，跳出坑外。后人有诗曰：“红光罩体困龙飞，征马冲开长坂围。四十二年真命主，将军因得显神威。”张郃见了，大惊而退。赵云纵马正走，背后忽有二将大叫：“赵云休走！”前面又有二将，使两般军器，截住去路：后面赶的是马延、张顗，前面阻的是焦触、张南，都是袁绍手下降将。赵云力战四将，曹军一齐拥至。云乃拔青釭剑乱砍，手起处，衣甲平过，血如涌泉。杀退众军将，直透重围。却说曹操在景山顶上，望见一将，所到之处，威不可当，急问左右是谁。曹洪飞马下山大叫曰：“军中战将可留姓名！”云应声曰：“吾乃常山赵子龙也！”曹洪回报曹操。操曰：“真虎将也！吾当生致之。”遂令飞马传报各处：“如赵云到，不许放冷箭，只要捉活的。”因此赵云得脱此难；此亦阿斗之福所致也。这一场杀：赵云怀抱后主，直透重围，砍倒大旗两面，夺槊三条；前后枪刺剑砍，杀死曹营名将五十余员。后人有诗曰：“血染征袍透甲红，当阳谁敢与争锋！古来冲阵扶危主，只有常山赵子龙。”\n赵云当下杀透重围，已离大阵，血满征袍。正行间，山坡下又撞出两枝军，乃夏侯惇部将钟缙、钟绅兄弟二人，一个使大斧，一个使画戟，大喝：“赵云快下马受缚！”正是：“才离虎窟愈生去，又遇龙潭鼓浪来。毕竟子龙怎地脱身，且听下回分解。
