忽然火光中一将引数骑杀上山来，视之，乃关兴也。兴伏地请曰：“四下火光逼近，不可久停。陛下速奔白帝城，再收军马可也。”先主曰：“谁敢断后？”傅彤奏曰：“臣愿以死当之！”当日黄昏，关兴在前，张苞在中，留傅彤断后，保着先主，杀下山来。吴兵见先主奔走，皆要争功，各引大军，遮天盖地，往西追赶，先主令军士尽脱袍铠，塞道而焚，以断后军。正奔走间，喊声大震，吴将朱然引一军从江岸边杀来，截住去路。先主叫曰：“朕死于此矣！”关兴、张苞纵马冲突，被乱箭射回，各带重伤，不能杀出。背后喊声又起，陆逊引大军从山谷中杀来。  \n  \n  　　先主正慌急之间，此时天色已微明，只见前面喊声震天，朱然军纷纷落涧，滚滚投岩：一彪军杀人，前来救驾。先主大喜，视之，乃常山赵子龙也。时赵云在川中江州，闻吴、蜀交兵，遂引军出；忽见东南一带火光冲天，云心惊，远远探视，不想先主被困，云奋勇冲杀而来。陆逊闻是赵云，急令军退。云正杀之间，忽遇朱然，便与交锋；不一合，一枪刺朱然于马下，杀散吴兵，救出先主，望白帝城而走。先主曰：“朕虽得脱，诸将士将奈何？”云曰：“敌军在后，不可久迟。陛下且入白帝城歇息，臣再引兵去救应诸将。”此时先主仅存百余人入白帝城。后人有诗赞陆逊曰：“持矛举火破连营，玄德穷奔白帝城。一旦威名惊蜀魏，吴王宁不敬书生。”  \n  \n  　　却说傅彤断后，被吴军八面围住。丁奉大叫曰：“川兵死者无数，降者极多，汝主刘备已被擒获，今汝力穷势孤，何不早降！”傅彤叱曰：“吾乃汉将，安肯降吴狗乎！”挺枪纵马，率蜀军奋力死战，不下百余合，往来冲突，不能得脱。彤长叹曰：“吾今休矣！”言讫，口中吐血，死于吴军之中。后人赞傅彤诗曰：“彝陵吴蜀大交兵，陆逊施谋用火焚。至死犹然骂吴狗，傅彤不愧汉将军。”  \n  \n  　　蜀祭酒程畿，匹马奔至江边，招呼水军赴敌，吴兵随后追来，水军四散奔逃。畿部将叫曰：“吴兵至矣！程祭酒快走罢！”畿怒曰：“吾自从主上出军，未尝赴敌而逃！”言未毕，吴兵骤至，四下无路，畿拔剑自刎。后人有诗赞曰：“慷慨蜀中\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
