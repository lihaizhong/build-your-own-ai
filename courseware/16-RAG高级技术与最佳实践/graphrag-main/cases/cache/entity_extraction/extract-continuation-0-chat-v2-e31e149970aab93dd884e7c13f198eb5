朱赞兵到，自相掩杀，人马大乱。曹遵与朱赞交马，方知自相践踏。急合兵时，忽四面喊声大震，王平、马岱、张嶷、张翼杀到。曹、朱二人引心腹军百余骑，望大路奔走。忽然鼓角齐鸣，一彪军截住去路，为首大将乃常山赵子龙也，大叫曰：“贼将那里去？早早受死！”曹、朱二人夺路而走。忽喊声又起，魏延又引一彪军杀到。曹、朱二人大败，夺路奔回本寨。守寨军士，只道蜀兵来劫寨，慌忙放起号火。左边曹真杀至，右边郭淮杀至，自相掩杀。背后三路蜀兵杀到：中央魏延，左边关兴，右边张苞，大杀一阵。魏兵败走十余里，魏将死者极多。孔明全获大胜，方始收兵。曹真、郭淮收拾败军回寨，商议曰：“今魏兵势孤，蜀兵势大，将何策以退之？”淮曰：“胜负乃兵家常事，不足为忧。某有一计，使蜀兵首尾不能相顾，定然自走矣。”正是：可怜魏将难成事，欲向西方索救兵。未知其计如何，且看下文分解。

　　却说西羌国王彻里吉，自曹操时年年入贡；手下有一文一武：文乃雅丹丞相，武乃越吉元帅。时魏使赍金珠并书到国，先来见雅丹丞相，送了礼物，具言求救之意。雅丹引见国王，呈上书礼。彻里吉览了书，与众商议。雅丹曰：“我与魏国素相往来，今曹都督求救，且许和亲，理合依允。”彻里吉从其言，即命雅丹与越吉元帅起羌兵一十五万，皆惯使弓弩、枪刀、蒺藜、飞锤等器；又有战车，用铁叶裹钉，装载粮食军器什物：或用骆驼驾车，或用骡马驾车，号为铁车兵。二人辞了国王，领兵直扣西平关。守关蜀将韩祯，急差人赍文报知孔明。孔明闻报，问众将曰：“谁敢去退羌兵？”张苞、关兴应曰：“某等愿往。”孔明曰：“汝二人要去，奈路途不熟。”遂唤马岱曰：“汝素知羌人之性，久居彼处，可作向导。”便起精兵五万，与兴、苞二人同往。兴、苞等引兵而去。\n######################\nOutput:"},
