十，而放勋禅以天下；大禹有疏导之绩，而重华禅以帝位。汉承尧运，有传圣之义，加顺灵袛，绍天明命，使行御史大夫张音，持节奉皇帝玺绶。王其受之！”  \n  \n  　　曹丕接诏欣喜，谓贾诩曰：“虽二次有诏，然终恐天下后世，不免篡窃之名也。”诩曰：“此事极易，可再命张音赍回玺绶，却教华歆令汉帝筑一坛，名受禅坛；择吉日良辰，集大小公卿，尽到坛下，令天子亲奉玺绶，禅天下与王，便可以释群疑而绝众议矣。”丕大喜，即令张音赍回玺绶，仍作表谦辞。音回奏献帝。帝问群臣曰：“魏王又让，其意若何？”华歆奏曰：“陛下可筑一坛，名曰受禅坛，集公卿庶民，明白禅位；则陛下子子孙孙，必蒙魏恩矣。”帝从之，乃遣太常院官，卜地于繁阳，筑起三层高坛，择于十月庚午日寅时禅让。  \n  \n  　　至期，献帝请魏王曹丕登坛受禅，坛下集大小官僚四百余员，御林虎贲禁军三十余万，帝亲捧玉玺奉曹丕。丕受之。坛下群臣跪听册曰：“咨尔魏王！昔者唐尧禅位于虞舜，舜亦以命禹：天命不于常，惟归有德。汉道陵迟，世失其序；降及朕躬，大乱滋昏，群凶恣逆，宇内颠覆。赖武王神武，拯兹难于四方，惟清区夏，以保绥我宗庙；岂予一人获乂，俾九服实受其赐。今王钦承前绪，光于乃德；恢文武之大业，昭尔考之弘烈。皇灵降瑞，人神告徵；诞惟亮采，师锡朕命。全曰尔度克协于虞舜，用率我唐典，敬逊尔位。於戏！天之历数在尔躬，君其袛顺大礼，飨万国以肃承天命！”  \n  \n  　　读册已毕，魏王曹丕即受八般大礼，登了帝位。贾诩引大小官僚朝于坛下。改延康元年为黄初元年。国号大魏。丕即传旨，大赦天下。谥父曹操为太祖武皇帝，华歆奏曰：“‘天无二日，民无二主’。汉帝既禅天下，理宜退就藩服。乞降明旨，安置刘氏于何地？”言讫，扶献帝跪于坛下听旨。丕降旨封帝为山阳公，即日便行。华歆按剑指帝，厉声而言曰：“立一帝，废一帝，古之常道！今上仁慈，不忍加害，封汝为山阳公。今日便行，非宣召不许入朝！”献帝含泪拜谢，上马而去。坛下军民人等见之，伤感不已。丕谓群臣曰：“舜、禹之事，朕知之矣！”群臣皆�\n######################\nOutput:"},
