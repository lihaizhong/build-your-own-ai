�公。渊心不足，与众商议，自号为燕王，改元绍汉元年。副将贾范谏曰：“中原待主公以上公之爵，不为卑贱；今若背反，实为不顺。更兼司马懿善能用兵，西蜀诸葛武侯且不能取胜，何况主公乎？”渊大怒，叱左右缚贾范，将斩之。参军伦直谏曰：“贾范之言是也。圣人云：国家将亡，必有妖孽。今国中屡见怪异之事：近有犬戴巾帻，身披红衣，上屋作人行；又城南乡民造饭，饭甑之中，忽有一小儿蒸死于内；襄平北市中，地忽陷一穴，涌出一块肉，周围数尺，头面眼耳口鼻都具，独无手足，刀箭不能伤，不知何物。卜者占之曰：有形不成，有口无声；国家亡灭，故现其形。有此三者，皆不祥之兆也。主公宜避凶就吉，不可轻举妄动。”渊勃然大怒，叱武士绑伦直并贾范同斩于市。令大将军卑衍为元帅，杨祚为先锋，起辽兵十五万，杀奔中原来。  \n  \n  　　边官报知魏主曹睿。睿大惊，乃召司马懿入朝计议。懿奏曰：“臣部下马步官军四万，足可破贼。”睿曰：“卿兵少路远，恐难收复。”懿曰：“兵不在多，在能设奇用智耳。臣托陛下洪福，必擒公孙渊以献陛下。”睿曰：“卿料公孙渊作何举动？”懿曰：“渊若弃城预走，是上计也；守辽东拒大军，是中计也；坐守襄平，是为下计，必被臣所擒矣。”睿曰：“此去往复几时？”懿曰：“四千里之地，往百日，攻百日，还百日，休息六十日，大约一年足矣。”睿曰：“倘吴、蜀入寇，如之奈何？”懿曰：“臣已定下守御之策，陛下勿忧。”睿大喜，即命司马懿兴师征讨公孙渊。  \n  \n  　　懿辞朝出城，令胡遵为先锋，引前部兵先到辽东下寨。哨马飞报公孙渊。渊令卑衍，杨祚分八万兵屯于辽隧，围堑二十余里，环绕鹿角，甚是严密。胡遵令人报知司马懿。懿笑曰：“贼不与我战，欲老我兵耳。我料贼众大半在此，其巢穴空虚，不若弃却此处，径奔襄平；贼必往救，却于中途击之，必获全功。”于是勒兵从小路向襄平进发。  \n  \n  　　却说卑衍与杨祚商议曰：“若魏兵来攻，休与交战。彼千里而来，粮草不继，难以持久，粮尽必退；待他退时，然后出奇兵击之，司马懿可擒也。昔司马懿与蜀兵相拒，坚守渭南，孔明竟卒于军中：今日正与此理相同。”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
