拽起吊桥。延、岱二人大叫：“早降！”姜维令人请杨仪商议曰：“魏延勇猛，更兼马岱相助，虽然军少，何计退之？”仪曰：“丞相临终，遗一锦囊，嘱曰：若魏延造反，临阵对敌之时，方可开拆，便有斩魏延之计。今当取出一看。”遂出锦囊拆封看时，题曰：“待与魏延对敌，马上方许拆开。”维大喜曰：“既丞相有戒约，长史可收执。吾先引兵出城，列为阵势，公可便来。”姜维披挂上马，绰枪在手，引三千军，开了城门，一齐冲出，鼓声大震，排成阵势。维挺枪立马于门旗之下，高声大骂曰：“反贼魏延！丞相不曾亏你，今日如何背反？”延横刀勒马而言曰：“伯约，不干你事。只教杨仪来！”仪在门旗影里，拆开锦囊视之，如此如此。仪大喜，轻骑而出，立马阵前，手指魏延而笑曰：“丞相在日，知汝久后必反，教我提备，今果应其言。汝敢在马上连叫三声谁敢杀我，便是真大丈夫，吾就献汉中城池与汝。”延大笑曰：“杨仪匹夫听着！若孔明在日，吾尚惧他三分；他今已亡，天下谁敢敌我？休道连叫三声，便叫三万声，亦有何难！”遂提刀按辔，于马上大叫曰：“谁敢杀我？”一声未毕，脑后一人厉声而应曰：“吾敢杀汝！”手起刀落，斩魏延于马下。众皆骇然。斩魏延者，乃马岱也。原来孔明临终之时，授马岱以密计，只待魏延喊叫时，便出其不意斩之；当日，杨仪读罢锦囊计策，已知伏下马岱在彼，故依计而行，果然杀了魏延。后人有诗曰：“诸葛先机识魏延，已知日后反西川。锦囊遗计人难料，却见成功在马前。”

　　后主还朝，杨仪自缚请罪。后主令近臣去其缚曰：“若非卿能依丞相遗教，灵柩何日得归，魏延如何得灭。大事保全，皆卿之力也。”遂加杨仪为中军师。马岱有讨逆之功，即以魏延之爵爵之。仪呈上孔明遗表。\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WEI
