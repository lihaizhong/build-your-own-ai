平蛮方；久闻幼常高见，望乞赐教。”谡曰：“愚有片言，望丞相察之；南蛮恃其地远山险，不服久矣；虽今日破之，明日复叛。丞相大军到彼，必然平服；但班师之日，必用北伐曹丕；蛮兵若知内虚，其反必速。夫用兵之道：攻心为上，攻城为下；心战为上，兵战为下。愿丞相但服其心足矣。”孔明叹曰：“幼常足知吾肺腑也！”于是孔明遂令马谡为参军，即统大兵前进。却说蛮王孟获，听知孔明智破雍闿等，遂聚三洞元帅商议。第一洞乃金环三结元帅，第二洞乃董荼那元帅，第三洞乃阿会喃元帅。三洞元帅入见孟获。获曰：“今诸葛丞相领大军来侵我境界，不得不并力敌之。汝三人可分兵三路而进。如得胜者，便为洞主。”于是分金环三结取中路，董荼那取左路，阿会喃取右路：各引五万蛮兵，依令而行。  \n  \n  　　却说孔明正在寨中议事，忽哨马飞报，说三洞元帅分兵三路到来。孔明听毕，即唤赵云、魏延至，却都不分付；更唤王平、马忠至，嘱之曰：“今蛮兵三路而来，吾欲令子龙、文长去；此二人不识地理，未敢用之。王平可往左路迎敌，马忠可往右路迎敌。吾却使子龙、文长随后接应。今日整顿军马，来日平明进发。”二人听令而去。又唤张嶷、张翼分付曰：“汝二人同领一军，往中路迎敌。今日整点军马，来日与王平、马忠约会而进。吾欲令子龙、文长去取，奈二人不识地理，故未敢用之。”张嶷、张翼听令去了。

　　赵云、魏延见孔明不用，各有愠色。孔明曰：“吾非不用汝二人，但恐以中年涉险，为蛮人所算，失其锐气耳。”赵云曰：“倘我等识地理，若何？”孔明曰：“汝二人只宜小心，休得妄动。”二人怏怏而退。赵云请魏延到自己寨内商议曰：“吾二人为先锋，却说不识地理而不肯用。今用此后辈，吾等岂不羞乎？”延曰：“吾二人只今就上马，亲去探之；捉住土人，便教引进，以敌蛮兵，大事可成。”云从之，遂上马径取中路而来。方行不数里，远远望见尘头大起。二人上山坡看时，果见数十骑蛮兵，纵马而来。二人两路冲出。蛮兵见了，大惊而走。赵云、魏延各生擒几人，回到本寨，以酒食待之，却细问其故。蛮兵告曰：“前面是金环三结元帅大寨，正在山口。寨边东西两路，却通五溪洞并董荼那、阿会喃各寨之后。”
