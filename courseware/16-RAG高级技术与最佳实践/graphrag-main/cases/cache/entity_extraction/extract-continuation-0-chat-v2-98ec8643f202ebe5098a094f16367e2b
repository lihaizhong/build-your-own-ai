上将，朝廷旧臣，反不如此小儿耶？吾当舍老命以报先帝之恩！”于是引兵来捉夏侯楙。当夜三路兵夹攻，大破魏军一阵。邓芝引兵接应，杀得尸横遍野，血流成河。夏侯楙乃无谋之人，更兼年幼，不曾经战，见军大乱，遂引帐下骁将百余人，望南安郡而走。众军因见无主，尽皆逃窜。兴、苞二将闻夏侯楙望南安郡去了，连夜赶来。楙走入城中，令紧闭城门，驱兵守御。兴、苞二人赶到，将城围住；赵云随后也到：三面攻打。少时，邓芝亦引兵到。一连围了十日，攻打不下。

　　忽报丞相留后军住沔阳，左军屯阳平，右军屯石城，自引中军来到。赵云、邓芝、关兴、张苞皆来拜问孔明，说连日攻城不下。孔明遂乘小车亲到城边周围看了一遍，回寨升帐而坐。众将环立听令。孔明曰：“此郡壕深城峻，不易攻也。吾正事不在此城，汝等如只久攻，倘魏兵分道而出，以取汉中，吾军危矣。”邓芝曰：“夏侯楙乃魏之驸马，若擒此人，胜斩百将。今困于此，岂可弃之而去？”孔明曰：“吾自有计。此处西连天水郡，北抵安定郡，二处太守，不知何人？”探卒答曰：“天水太守马遵，安定太守崔谅。”孔明大喜，乃唤魏延受计，如此如此；又唤关兴、张苞受计，如此如此；又唤心腹军士二人受计，如此行之。各将领命，引兵而去。孔明却在南安城外，令军运柴草堆于城下，口称烧城。魏兵闻知，皆大笑不惧。却说安定太守崔谅，在城中闻蜀兵围了南安，困住夏侯楙，十分慌惧，即点军马约共四千，守住城池。忽见一人自正南而来，口称有机密事。崔谅唤入问之，答曰：“某是夏侯都督帐下心腹将裴绪。今奉都督将令，特来求救于天水、安定二郡。南安甚急，每日城上纵火为号，专望二郡救兵，并不见到；因复差某杀出重围，来此告急。可星夜起兵为外应。都督若见二郡兵到，却开城门接应也。”谅曰：“有都督文书否？”绪贴肉取出，汗已湿透；略教一视，急令手下换了乏马，便出城望天水而去。不二日，又有报马到，告天水太守已起兵救援南安去了，教安定早早接应。崔谅与府官商议。多官曰：“若不去救，失了南安，送了夏侯驸马，皆我两郡之罪也：只得救之。”谅即点起人马，离城而去，只留文官守城。
