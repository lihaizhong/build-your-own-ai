　　于是曹丕安居王位，改建安二十五年为延康元年；封贾诩为太尉，华歆为相国，王朗为御史大夫；大小官僚，尽皆升赏。谥曹操曰武王，葬于邺郡高陵，令于禁董治陵事。禁奉命到彼，只见陵屋中白粉壁上，图画关云长水淹七军擒获于禁之事：画云长俨然上坐，庞德愤怒不屈，于禁拜伏于地，哀求乞命之状。原来曹丕以于禁兵败被擒，不能死节，既降敌而复归，心鄙其为人，故先令人图画陵屋粉壁，故意使之往见以愧之。当下于禁见此画像，又羞又恼，气愤成病，不久而死。后人有诗叹曰：“三十年来说旧交，可怜临难不忠曹。知人未向心中识，画虎今从骨里描。”  \n  \n  　　却说华歆奏曹丕曰：“鄢陵侯已交割军马，赴本国去了；临淄侯植、萧怀侯熊，二人竟不来奔丧，理当问罪，丕从之，即分遣二使往二处问罪。不一日，萧怀使者回报：“萧怀侯曹熊惧罪，自缢身死。”丕令厚葬之，追赠萧怀王。又过了一日，临淄使者回报，说：“临淄侯日与丁仪、丁廙兄弟二人酣饮，悖慢无礼，闻使命至，临淄侯端坐不动；丁仪骂曰：昔者先王本欲立吾主为世子，被谗臣所阻；今王丧未远，便问罪于骨肉，何也？丁廙又曰：据吾主聪明冠世，自当承嗣大位，今反不得立。汝那庙堂之臣，何不识人才若此！临淄侯因怒，叱武士将臣乱棒打出。”  \n  \n  　　丕闻之，大怒，即令许褚领虎卫军三千，火速至临淄擒曹植等一千人来。褚奉命，引军至临淄城。守将拦阻，褚立斩之，直入城中，无一人敢当锋锐，径到府堂。只见曹植与丁仪、丁廙等尽皆醉倒。褚皆缚之，载于车上，并将府下大小属官，尽行拿解邺郡，听候曹丕发落。丕下令，先将丁仪、丁廙等尽行诛戳。丁仪字正礼，丁廙字敬礼，沛郡人，乃一时文士；及其被杀，人多惜之。  \n  \n  　　却说曹丕之母卞氏，听得曹熊缢死，心甚悲伤；忽又闻曹植被擒，其党丁仪等已杀，大惊。急出殿，召曹丕相见。丕见母出殿，慌来拜谒。卞氏哭谓丕曰：“汝弟植平生嗜酒疏狂，盖因自恃胸中之才，故尔放纵。汝可念同胞之情，存其性命。吾至九泉亦瞑目也。”\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
