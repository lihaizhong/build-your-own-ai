望免我一命！”歆叱曰：“汝自见魏公诉去！”后披发跣足，二甲士推拥而出。原来华歆素有才名，向与邴原、管宁相友善。时人称三人为一龙：华歆为龙头，邴原为龙腹，管宁为龙尾。一日，宁与歆共种园蔬，锄地见金。宁挥锄不顾；歆拾而视之，然后掷下。又一日，宁与歆同坐观书，闻户外传呼之声，有贵人乘轩而过。宁端坐不动，歆弃书往观。宁自此鄙歆之为人，遂割席分坐，不复与之为友。后来管宁避居辽东，常戴白帽，坐卧一楼，足不履地，终身不肯仕魏；而歆乃先事孙权，后归曹操，至此乃有收捕伏皇后一事。后人有诗叹华歆曰：“华歆当日逞凶谋，破壁生将母后收。助虐一朝添虎翼，骂名千载笑龙头！”又有诗赞管宁曰：“辽东传有管宁楼，人去楼空名独留。笑杀子鱼贪富贵，岂如白帽自风流。”\n且说华歆将伏后拥至外殿。帝望见后，乃下殿抱后而哭。歆曰：“魏公有命，可速行！”后哭谓帝曰：“不能复相活耶？”帝曰：“我命亦不知在何时也！”甲士拥后而去，帝捶胸大恸。见郗虑在侧，帝曰：“郗公！天下宁有是事乎！”哭倒在地。郗虑令左右扶帝入宫。华歆拿伏后见操。操骂曰：“吾以诚心待汝等，汝等反欲害我耶！吾不杀汝，汝必杀我！”喝左右乱棒打死。随即入宫，将伏后所生二子，皆鸩杀之。当晚将伏完、穆顺等宗族二百余口，皆斩于市。朝野之人，无不惊骇。时建安十九年十一月也。后人有诗叹曰：“曹瞒凶残世所无，伏完忠义欲何如。可怜帝后分离处，不及民间妇与夫！”\n献帝自从坏了伏后，连日不食。操入曰：“陛下无忧，臣无异心。臣女已与陛下为贵人，大贤大孝，宜居正宫。”献帝安敢不从。于建安二十年正月朔，就庆贺正旦之节，册立曹操女曹贵人为正宫皇后。群下莫敢有言。\n此时曹操威势日甚。会大臣商议收吴灭蜀之事。贾诩曰：“须召夏侯惇、曹仁二人回，商议此事。”操即时发使，星夜唤回。夏侯惇未至，曹仁先到，连夜便入府中见操。操方被酒而卧，许褚仗剑立于堂门之内，曹仁欲入，被许褚当住。曹仁大怒曰：“吾乃曹氏宗族，汝何敢阻当耶？”许褚曰：“将军虽亲，乃外藩镇守之官；许褚虽疏，现充内侍。主公醉卧堂上，不敢放入。”�\n######################\nOutput:"},
