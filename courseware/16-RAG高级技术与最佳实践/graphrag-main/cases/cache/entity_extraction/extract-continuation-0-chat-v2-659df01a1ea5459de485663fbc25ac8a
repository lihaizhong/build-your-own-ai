　　且说孔明自引一军屯于五丈原，累令人搦战，魏兵只不出。孔明乃取巾帼并妇人缟素之服，盛于大盒之内，修书一封，遣人送至魏寨。诸将不敢隐蔽，引来使入见司马懿。懿对众启盒视之，内有巾帼妇人之衣，并书一封。懿拆视其书，略曰：“仲达既为大将，统领中原之众，不思披坚执锐，以决雌雄，乃甘窟守土巢，谨避刀箭，与妇人又何异哉！今遣人送巾帼素衣至，如不出战，可再拜而受之。倘耻心未泯，犹有男子胸襟，早与批回，依期赴敌。”司马懿看毕，心中大怒，乃佯笑曰：“孔明视我为妇人耶！”即受之，令重待来使。懿问曰：“孔明寝食及事之烦简若何？”使者曰：“丞相夙兴夜寐，罚二十以上皆亲览焉。所啖之食，日不过数升。”懿顾谓诸将曰：“孔明食少事烦，其能久乎？”  \n  \n  　　使者辞去，回到五丈原，见了孔明，具说：“司马懿受了巾帼女衣，看了书札，并不嗔怒，只问丞相寝食及事之烦简，绝不提起军旅之事。某如此应对，彼言：食少事烦，岂能长久？”孔明叹曰：“彼深知我也！”主簿杨顒谏曰：“某见丞相常自校簿书，窃以为不必。夫为治有体，上下不可相侵。譬之治家之道，必使仆执耕，婢典爨，私业无旷，所求皆足，其家主从容自在，高枕饮食而已。若皆身亲其事，将形疲神困，终无一成。岂其智之不如婢仆哉？失为家主之道也。是故古人称：坐而论道，谓之三公；作而行之，谓之士大夫。昔丙吉忧牛喘，而不问横道死人；陈平不知钱谷之数，曰：自有主者。今丞相亲理细事，汗流终日岂不劳乎？司马懿之言，真至言也。”孔明泣曰：“吾非不知。但受先帝托孤之重，惟恐他人不似我尽心也！”众皆垂泪。自此孔明自觉神思不宁。诸将因此未敢进兵。却说魏将皆知孔明以巾帼女衣辱司马懿，懿受之不战。众将不忿，入帐告曰：“我等皆大国名将，安忍受蜀人如此之辱！即请出战，以决雌雄。”懿曰：“吾非不敢出战而甘心受辱也。奈天子明诏，令坚守勿动。今若轻出，有违君命矣。”众将俱忿怒不平。懿曰：“汝等既要出战，待我奏准天子，同力赴敌，何如？”众皆允诺。懿乃写表遣使，直至合淝军前，奏闻魏主曹睿。睿拆表览之。表略曰：“臣�\n######################\nOutput:"},
