于非命，果应管辂之言。后人有诗赞管辂曰：“传得圣贤真妙诀，平原管辂相通神。鬼幽鬼躁分何邓，未丧先知是死人。”却说魏主曹芳封司马懿为丞相，加九锡。懿固辞不肯受。芳不准，令父子三人同领国事。懿忽然想起：“曹爽全家虽诛，尚有夏侯玄守备雍州等处，系爽亲族，倘骤然作乱，如何提备？必当处置。”即下诏遣使往雍州，取征西将军夏侯玄赴洛阳议事。玄叔夏侯霸听知大惊，便引本部三千兵造反。有镇守雍州刺史郭淮，听知夏侯霸反，即率本部兵来，与夏侯霸交战。淮出马大骂曰：“汝既是大魏皇族，天子又不曾亏汝，何故背反？”霸亦骂曰：“吾祖父于国家多建勤劳，今司马懿何等匹夫，灭吾兄曹爽宗族，又来取我，早晚必思篡位。吾仗义讨贼，何反之有？”淮大怒，挺枪骤马，直取夏侯霸。霸挥刀纵马来迎。战不十合，淮败走，霸随后赶来。忽听的后军呐喊，霸急回马时，陈泰引兵杀来。郭淮复回，两路夹攻。霸大败而走，折兵大半；寻思无计，遂投汉中来降后主。
