苞受了孔明密计，披挂上马，各执兵器，杂在安定军中，随崔谅来到南安城下。杨陵在城上撑起悬空板，倚定护心栏，问曰：“何处军马？”崔谅曰：“安定救军来到。”谅先射一号箭上城，箭上带着密书曰：“今诸葛亮先遣二将，伏于城中，要里应外合；且不可惊动，恐泄漏计策。待入府中图之。”杨陵将书见了夏侯楙，细言其事。楙曰：“既然诸葛亮中计，可教刀斧手百余人，伏于府中。如二将随崔太守到府下马，闭门斩之；却于城上举火，赚诸葛亮入城。伏兵齐出，亮可擒矣。”  \n  \n  　　安排已毕，杨陵回到城上言曰：“既是安定军马，可放入城。”关兴跟崔谅先行，张苞在后。杨陵下城，在门边迎接。兴手起刀落，斩杨陵于马下。崔谅大惊，急拨马奔到吊桥边，张苞大喝曰：“贼子休走！汝等诡计，如何瞒得丞相耶！”手起一枪，刺崔谅于马下。关兴早到城上，放起火来。四面蜀兵齐入。夏侯楙措手不及，开南门并力杀出。一彪军拦住，为首大将，乃是王平；交马只一合，生擒夏侯楙于马上，余皆杀死。孔明入南安，招谕军民，秋毫无犯。众将各各献功。孔明将夏侯楙囚于车中。邓芝问曰：“丞相何故知崔谅诈也？”孔明曰：“吾已知此人无降心，故意使入城。彼必尽情告与夏侯楙，欲将计就计而行。吾见来情，足知其诈，复使二将同去，以稳其心。此人若有真心，必然阻当；彼忻然同去者，恐吾疑也。他意中度二将同去，赚入城内杀之未迟；又令吾军有托，放心而进。吾已暗嘱二将，就城门下图之。城内必无准备，吾军随后便到。此出其不意也。”众将拜服。孔明曰：“赚崔谅者，吾使心腹人诈作魏将裴绪也。吾又去赚天水郡，至今未到，不知何故。今可乘势取之。”乃留吴懿守南安，刘琰守安定，替出魏延军马去取天水郡。
