营中皆是魏兵旌旗。申耽、申仪从营中杀出。王平、魏延径奔列柳城，来投高翔。此时高翔闻知街亭有失，尽起列柳城之兵，前来救应，正遇延、平二人，诉说前事。高翔曰：“不如今晚去劫魏寨，再复街亭。”当时三人在山坡下商议已定。待天色将晚，兵分三路。魏延引兵先进，径到街亭，不见一人，心中大疑，未敢轻进，且伏在路口等候，忽见高翔兵到，二人共说魏兵不知在何处。正没理会，又不见王平兵到。忽然一声炮响，火光冲天，鼓起震地：魏兵齐出，把魏延、高翔围在垓心。二人往来冲突，不得脱身。忽听得山坡后喊声若雷，一彪军杀入，乃是王平，救了高、魏二人，径奔列柳城来。比及奔到城下时，城边早有一军杀到，旗上大书“魏都督郭淮”字样。原来郭淮与曹真商议，恐司马懿得了全功，乃分淮来取街亭；闻知司马懿、张郃成了此功，遂引兵径袭列柳城。正遇三将，大杀一阵。蜀兵伤者极多。魏延恐阳平关有失，慌与王平、高翔望阳平关来。  \n  \n  　　却说郭淮收了军马，乃谓左右曰：“吾虽不得街亭，却取了列柳城，亦是大功。”引兵径到城下叫门，只见城上一声炮响，旗帜皆竖，当头一面大旗，上书“平西都督司马懿”。懿撑起悬空板，倚定护心木栏干，大笑曰：“郭伯济来何迟也？”淮大惊曰：“仲达神机，吾不及也！”遂入城。相见已毕，懿曰：“今街亭已失，诸葛亮必走。公可速与子丹星夜追之。”郭淮从其言，出城而去。懿唤张郃曰：“子丹、伯济，恐吾全获大功，故来取此城池。吾非独欲成功，乃侥幸而已。吾料魏延、王平、马谡、高翔等辈，必先去据阳平关。吾若去取此关，诸葛亮必随后掩杀，中其计矣。兵法云：归师勿掩，穷寇莫追。汝可从小路抄箕谷退兵。吾自引兵当斜谷之兵。若彼败走，不可相拒，只宜中途截住：蜀兵辎重，可尽得也。”张郃受计，引兵一半去了。懿下令：“竟取斜谷，由西城而进。西城虽山僻小县，乃蜀兵屯粮之所，又南安、天水、安定三郡总路。若得此城，三郡可复矣。”于是司马懿留申耽、申仪守列柳城，自领大军望斜谷进发。
