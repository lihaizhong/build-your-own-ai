军，只见满山火光齐明，鼓角大震，伏兵四下皆出，把二人围住。孔明在祁山上大叫曰：“戴陵、张郃可听吾言：司马懿料吾往武都、阴平抚民，不在营中，故令汝二人来劫吾寨，却中吾之计也。汝二人乃无名下将，吾不杀害，下马早降！”郃大怒，指孔明而骂曰：“汝乃山野村夫，侵吾大国境界，如何敢发此言！吾若捉住汝时，碎尸万段！”言讫，纵马挺枪，杀上山来。山上矢石如雨，郃不能上山，乃拍马舞枪，冲出重围，无人敢当。蜀兵困戴陵在垓心。郃杀出旧路，不见戴陵，即奋勇翻身又杀入重围，救出戴陵而回。孔明在山上，见郃在万军之中，往来冲突，英勇倍加，乃谓左右曰：“尝闻张翼德大战张郃，人皆惊惧。吾今日见之，方知其勇也。若留下此人，必为蜀中之害。吾当除之。”遂收军还营。  \n  \n  　　却说司马懿引兵布成阵势，只待蜀兵乱动，一齐攻之。忽见张郃、戴陵狼狈而来，告曰：“孔明先如此提防，因此大败而归。”懿大惊曰：“孔明真神人也！不如且退。”即传令教大军尽回本寨，坚守不出。且说孔明大胜，所得器械、马匹，不计其数，乃引大军回寨。每日令魏延挑战，魏兵不出。一连半月，不曾交兵。孔明正在帐中思虑，忽报天子遣侍中费祎赍诏至。孔明接入营中，焚香礼毕，开诏读曰：“街亭之役，咎由马谡；而君引愆，深自贬抑。重违君意，听顺所守。前年耀师，馘斩王双；今岁爱征，郭淮遁走；降集氏、羌，复兴二郡：威震凶暴，功勋显然。方今天下骚扰，元恶未枭，君受大任，干国之重，而久自抑损，非所以光扬洪烈矣。今复君丞相，君其勿辞！”孔明听诏毕，谓费祎曰：“吾国事未成，安可复丞相之职？”坚辞不受。祎曰：“丞相若不受职，拂了天子之意，又冷淡了将士之心。宜且权受。”孔明方才拜受。祎辞去。  \n  \n  　　孔明见司马懿不出，思得一计，传令教各处皆拔寨而起。当有细作报知司马懿，说孔明退兵了。懿曰：“孔明必有大谋，不可轻动。”张郃曰：“此必因粮尽而回，如何不追？”懿曰：“吾料孔明上年大收，今又麦熟，粮草丰足；虽然转运艰难，亦可支吾半载，安肯便走？彼见吾连日不战，故作此计引诱。可令人远远哨之。”军士�\n######################\nOutput:"},
