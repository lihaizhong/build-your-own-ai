泪沾襟。”初，蜀长水校尉廖立，自谓才名宜为孔明之副，尝以职位闲散，怏怏不平，怨谤无已。于是孔明废之为庶人，徒之汶山。及闻孔明亡，乃垂泣曰：“吾终为左衽矣！”李严闻之，亦大哭病死，盖严尝望孔明复收己，得自补前过；度孔明死后，人不能用之故也。后元微之有赞孔明诗曰：“拨乱扶危主，殷勤受托孤。英才过管乐，妙策胜孙吴。凛凛《出师表》，堂堂八阵图。如公全盛德，应叹古今无！”  \n  \n  　　是夜，天愁地惨，月色无光，孔明奄然归天。姜维、杨仪遵孔明遗命，不敢举哀，依法成殓，安置龛中，令心腹将卒三百人守护；随传密令，使魏延断后，各处营寨一一退去。  \n  \n  　　却说司马懿夜观天文，见一大星，赤色，光芒有角，自东北方流于西南方，坠于蜀营内，三投再起，隐隐有声。懿惊喜曰：“孔明死矣！”即传令起大兵追之。方出寨门，忽又疑虑曰：“孔明善会六丁六甲之法，今见我久不出战，故以此术诈死，诱我出耳。今若追之，必中其计。”遂复勒马回寨不出，只令夏侯霸暗引数十骑，往五丈原山僻哨探消息。  \n  \n  　　却说魏延在本寨中，夜作一梦，梦见头上忽生二角，醒来甚是疑异。次日，行军司马赵直至，延请入问曰：“久知足下深明《易》理，吾夜梦头生二角，不知主何吉凶？烦足下为我决之。”赵直想了半晌，答曰：“此大吉之兆：麒麟头上有角，苍龙头上有角，乃变化飞腾之象也。”延大喜曰：“如应公言，当有重谢！”直辞去，行不数里，正遇尚书费祎。祎问何来。直曰：“适至魏文长营中，文长梦头生角，令我决其吉凶。此本非吉兆，但恐直言见怪，因以麒麟苍龙解之。”祎曰：“足下何以知非吉兆？”直曰：“角之字形，乃刀下用也。今头上用刀，其凶甚矣！”祎曰：“君且勿泄漏。”直别去。费祎至魏延寨中，屏退左右，告曰：“昨夜三更，丞相已辞世矣。临终再三嘱付，令将军断后以当司马懿，缓缓而退，不可发丧。今兵符在此，便可起兵。”延曰：“何人代理丞相之大事？”祎曰：“丞相一应大事，尽托与杨仪；用兵密法，皆授与姜伯约。此兵符乃杨仪之令也。”延曰：“丞相虽亡，吾今现在。杨仪不过一长史，安能当此大任？他只宜扶柩入川安葬。我自率大兵攻司马懿，务要成功。�\n######################\nOutput:"},
