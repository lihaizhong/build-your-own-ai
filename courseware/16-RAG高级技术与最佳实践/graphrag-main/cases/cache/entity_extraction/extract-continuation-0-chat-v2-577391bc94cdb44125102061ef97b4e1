三路去劫魏寨，指望克复街亭。因见街亭并无伏路军，以此心疑。登高望之，只见魏延、高翔被魏兵围住，某即杀入重围，救出二将，就同参军并在一处。某恐失却阳平关，因此急来回守。非某之不谏也。丞相不信，可问各部将校。”孔明喝退，又唤马谡入帐。  \n  \n  　　谡自缚跪于帐前。孔明变色曰：“汝自幼饱读兵书，熟谙战法。吾累次丁宁告戒：街亭是吾根本。汝以全家之命，领此重任。汝若早听王平之言，岂有此祸？今败军折将，失地陷城，皆汝之过也！若不明正军律，何以服众？汝今犯法，休得怨吾。汝死之后，汝之家小，吾按月给与禄粮，汝不必挂心。”叱左右推出斩之。谡泣曰：“丞相视某如子，某以丞相为父。某之死罪，实已难逃；愿丞相思舜帝殛鲧用禹之义，某虽死亦无恨于九泉！”言讫大哭。孔明挥泪曰：“吾与汝义同兄弟，汝之子即吾之子也，不必多嘱。”左右推出马谡于辕门之外，将斩。参军蒋琬自成都至，见武士欲斩马谡，大惊，高叫：“留人！”入见孔明曰：“昔楚杀得臣而文公喜。今天下未定，而戮智谋之臣，岂不可惜乎？”孔明流涕而答曰：“昔孙武所以能制胜于天下者，用法明也。今四方分争，兵戈方始，若复废法，何以讨贼耶？合当斩之。”须臾，武士献马谡首级于阶下。孔明大哭不已。蒋琬问曰：“今幼常得罪，既正军法，丞相何故哭耶？”孔明曰：“吾非为马谡而哭。吾想先帝在白帝城临危之时，曾嘱吾曰：“马谡言过其实，不可大用。今果应此言。乃深恨己之不明，追思先帝之言，因此痛哭耳！”大小将士，无不流涕。马谡亡年三十九岁，时建兴六年夏五月也。后人有诗曰：“失守街亭罪不轻，堪嗟马谡枉谈兵。辕门斩首严军法，拭泪犹思先帝明。”  \n  \n  　　却说孔明斩了马谡，将首级遍示各营已毕，用线缝在尸上，具棺葬之，自修祭文享祀；将谡家小加意抚恤，按月给与禄米。于是孔明自作表文，令蒋琬申奏后主，请自贬丞相之职。琬回成都，入见后主，进上孔明表章。后主拆视之。表曰：“臣本庸才，叨窃非据，亲秉旄钺，以励三军。不能训章明法，临事而惧，至有街亭违命之阙，箕谷不戒之失。咎皆在臣，授任无方。臣明不知人，恤事多暗。《春秋》责帅，臣职是当。请自贬三等，以督厥�\n######################\nOutput:"},
