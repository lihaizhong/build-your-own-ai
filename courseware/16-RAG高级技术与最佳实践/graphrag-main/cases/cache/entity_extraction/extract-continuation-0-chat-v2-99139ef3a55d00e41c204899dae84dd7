后魏兵赶来。刘封到城下叫门，城上乱箭射下。申耽在敌楼上叫曰：“吾已降了魏也！”封大怒，欲要攻城，背后追军将至，封立脚不住，只得望房陵而奔，见城上已尽插魏旗。申仪在敌楼上将旗一飐，城后一彪军出，旗上大书“右将军徐晃”。封抵敌不住，急望西川而走。晃乘势追杀。刘封部下只剩得百余骑。到了成都，入见汉中王，哭拜于地，细奏前事。玄德怒曰：“辱子有何面目复来见吾！”封曰：“叔父之难，非儿不救，因孟达谏阻故耳。”玄德转怒曰：“汝须食人食、穿人衣，非土木偶人！安可听谗贼所阻！”命左右推出斩之。汉中王既斩刘封，后闻孟达招之，毁书斩使之事，心中颇悔；又哀痛关公，以致染病。因此按兵不动。  \n  \n  　　且说魏王曹丕，自即王位，将文武官僚，尽皆升赏；遂统甲兵三十万，南巡沛国谯县，大飨先茔。乡中父老，扬尘遮道，奉觞进酒，效汉高祖还沛之事。人报大将军夏侯惇病危，丕即还邺郡。时惇已卒，不为挂孝，以厚礼殉葬。  \n  \n  　　是岁八月间，报称石邑县凤凰来仪，临淄城麒麟出现，黄龙现于邺郡。于是中郎将李伏、太史丞许芝商议：种种瑞徵，乃魏当代汉之兆，可安排受禅之礼，令汉帝将天下让于魏王。遂同华歆、王朗、辛毗、贾诩、刘廙、刘晔、陈矫、陈群、桓阶等一班文武官僚，四十余人，直入内殿，来奏汉献帝，请禅位于魏王曹丕。正是：魏家社稷今将建，汉代江山忽已移。未知献帝如何回答，且看下文分解。  \n三国演义全集03\n正文
