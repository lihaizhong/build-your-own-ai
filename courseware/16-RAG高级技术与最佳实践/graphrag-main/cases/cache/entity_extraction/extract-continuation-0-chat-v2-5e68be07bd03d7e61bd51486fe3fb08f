悄望湖口进发；将近水寨，一齐呐喊杀入。吴兵慌乱，不战而走；被魏军四下举火，烧毁战船、粮草、器具不计其数。诸葛瑾率败兵逃走沔口。魏兵大胜而回。  \n  \n  　　次日，哨军报知陆逊。逊集诸将议曰：“吾当作表申奏主上，请撤新城之围，以兵断魏军归路，吾率众攻其前：彼首尾不敌，一鼓可破也。”众服其言。陆逊即具表，遣一小校密地赍往新城。小校领命，赍着表文，行至渡口，不期被魏军伏路的捉住，解赴军中见魏主曹睿。睿搜出陆逊表文，览毕，叹曰：“东吴陆逊真妙算也！”遂命将吴卒监下，令刘劭谨防孙权后兵。却说诸葛瑾大败一阵，又值暑天，人马多生疾病；乃修书一封，令人转达陆逊，议欲撤兵还国。逊看书毕，谓来人曰：“拜上将军：吾自有主意。”使者回报诸葛瑾。瑾问：“陆将军作何举动？”使者曰：“但见陆将军催督众人于营外种豆菽，自与诸将在辕门射戏。”瑾大惊，亲自往陆逊营中，与逊相见，问曰：“今曹睿亲来，兵势甚盛，都督何以御之？”逊曰：“吾前遣人奉表于主上，不料为敌人所获。机谋既泄，彼必知备；与战无益，不如且退。已差人奉表约主上缓缓退兵矣。”瑾曰：“都督既有此意，即宜速退，何又迟延？”逊曰：“吾军欲退，当徐徐而动。今若便退，魏人必乘势追赶：此取败之道也。足下宜先督船只诈为拒敌之意，吾悉以人马向襄阳而进，为疑敌之计，然后徐徐退归江东，魏兵自不敢近耳。”瑾依其计，辞逊归本营，整顿船只，预备起行。陆逊整肃部伍，张扬声势，望襄阳进发。
