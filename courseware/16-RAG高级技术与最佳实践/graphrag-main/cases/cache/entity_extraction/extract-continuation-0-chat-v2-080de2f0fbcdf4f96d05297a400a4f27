何国舅谋诛宦竖\n\n且说董卓字仲颖，陇西临洮人也，官拜河东太守，自来骄傲。当日怠慢了玄德，张飞性发，便欲杀之。玄德与关公急止之曰；“他是朝廷命官，岂可擅杀？”飞曰：“若不杀这厮，反要在他部下听令，其实不甘！二兄要便住在此，我自投别处去也！”玄德曰：“我三人义同生死，岂可相离？不若都投别处去便了。”飞曰：“若如此，稍解吾恨。”\n于是三人连夜引军来投朱儁。儁待之甚厚，合兵一处，进讨张宝。是时曹操自跟皇甫嵩讨张梁，大战于曲阳。这里朱儁进攻张宝。张宝引贼众八九万，屯于山后。儁令玄德为其先锋，与贼对敌。张宝遣副将高升出马搦战，玄德使张飞击之。飞纵马挺矛，与升交战，不数合，刺升落马。玄德麾军直冲过去。张宝就马上披发仗剑，作起妖法。只见风雷大作，一股黑气从天而降，黑气中似有无限人马杀来。玄德连忙回军，军中大乱。败阵而归，与朱儁计议。儁曰：“彼用妖术，我来日可宰猪羊狗血，令军士伏于山头；候贼赶来，从高坡上泼之，其法可解。”玄德听令，拨关公、张飞各引军一千，伏于山后高冈之上，盛猪羊狗血并秽物准备。次日，张宝摇旗擂鼓，引军搦战，玄德出迎。交锋之际，张宝作法，风雷大作，飞砂走石，黑气漫天，滚滚人马，自天而下。玄德拨马便走，张宝驱兵赶来。将过山头，关、张伏军放起号炮，秽物齐泼。但见空中纸人草马，纷纷坠地；风雷顿息，砂石不飞。\n张宝见解了法，急欲退军。左关公，右张飞，两军都出，背后玄德、朱儁一齐赶上，贼兵大败。玄德望见“地公将军”旗号，飞马赶来，张宝落荒而走。玄德发箭，中其左臂。张宝带箭逃脱，走入阳城，坚守不出。\n朱儁引兵围住阳城攻打，一面差人打探皇甫嵩消息。探子回报，具说：“皇甫嵩大获胜捷，朝廷以董卓屡败，命嵩代之。嵩到时，张角已死；张梁统其众，与我军相拒，被皇\n######################\nOutput:"},
