　　却说诸葛丞相在于成都，事无大小，皆亲自从公决断。两川之民，忻乐太平，夜不闭户，路不拾遗。又幸连年大熟，老幼鼓腹讴歌，凡遇差徭，争先早办。因此军需器械应用之物，无不完备；米满仓廒，财盈府库。  \n  \n  　　建兴三年，益州飞报：蛮王孟获，大起蛮兵十万，犯境侵掠。建宁太守雍闿，乃汉朝什方侯雍齿之后，今结连孟获造反。牂牁郡太守朱褒、越嶲郡太守高定，二人献了城。止有永昌太守王伉不肯反。现今雍闿、朱褒、高定三人部下人马，皆与孟获为向导官，攻打永昌郡。今王伉与功曹吕凯，会集百姓，死守此城，其势甚急。孔明乃入朝奏后主曰：“臣观南蛮不服，实国家之大患也。臣当自领大军，前去征讨。”后主曰“东有孙权，北有曹丕，今相父弃朕而去，倘吴、魏来攻，如之奈何？”孔明曰：“东吴方与我国讲和，料无异心；若有异心，李严在白帝城，此人可当陆逊也。曹丕新败，锐气已丧，未能远图；且有马超守把汉中诸处关口，不必忧也。臣又留关兴、张苞等分两军为救应，保陛下万无一失。今臣先去扫荡蛮方，然后北伐，以图中原，报先帝三顾之恩，托孤之重。”后主曰：“朕年幼无知，惟相父斟酌行之。”言未毕，班部内一人出曰：“不可！不可！”众视之，乃南阳人也，姓王，名连，字文仪，现为谏议大夫。连谏曰\n------------\n\n分节阅读
