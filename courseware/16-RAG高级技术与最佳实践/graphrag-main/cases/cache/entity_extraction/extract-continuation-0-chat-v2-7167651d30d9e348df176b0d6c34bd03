未知吾主安危若何。若魏主以礼待之，则举城而降，未为晚也；万一危辱吾主，则主辱臣死，何可降乎？”众然其言，乃使人到洛阳，探听后主消息去了。  \n  \n  　　且说后主至洛阳时，司马昭已自回朝。昭责后主曰：“公荒淫无道，废贤失政，理宜诛戮。”后主面如土色，不知所为。文武皆奏曰：“蜀主既失国纪，幸早归降，宜赦之。”昭乃封禅为安乐公，赐住宅，月给用度，赐绢万匹，僮婢百人。子刘瑶及群臣樊建、谯周、郤正等，皆封侯爵。后主谢恩出内。昭因黄皓蠹国害民，令武士押出市曹，凌迟处死。时霍戈探听得后主受封，遂率部下军士来降。次日，后主亲诣司马昭府下拜谢。昭设宴款待，先以魏乐舞戏于前，蜀官感伤，独后主有喜色。昭令蜀人扮蜀乐于前，蜀官尽皆堕泪，后主嬉笑自若。酒至半酣，昭谓贾充曰：“人之无情，乃至于此！虽使诸葛孔明在，亦不能辅之久全，何况姜维乎？”乃问后主曰：“颇思蜀否？”后主曰：“此间乐，不思蜀也。”须臾，后主起身更衣，郤正跟至厢下曰：“陛下如何答应不思蜀也？徜彼再问，可泣而答曰：先人坟墓，远在蜀地，乃心西悲，无日不思。晋公必放陛下归蜀矣。”后主牢记入席。酒将微醉，昭又问曰：“颇思蜀否？”后主如郤正之言以对，欲哭无泪，遂闭其目。昭曰：“何乃似郤正语耶？”后主开目惊视曰：“诚如尊命。”昭及左右皆笑之。昭因此深喜后主诚实，并不疑虑。后人有诗叹曰：“追欢作乐笑颜开，不念危亡半点哀。快乐异乡忘故国，方知后主是庸才。”  \n  \n  　　却说朝中大臣因昭收川有功，遂尊之为王，表奏魏主曹奂。时奂名为天子，实不能主张，政皆由司马氏，不敢不从，遂封晋公司马昭为晋王，谥父司马懿为宣王，兄司马师为景王。昭妻乃王肃之女，生二子：长曰司马炎，人物魁伟，立发垂地，两手过膝，聪明英武，胆量过人；次曰司马攸，情性温和，恭俭孝悌，昭甚爱之，因司马师无子，嗣攸以继其后。昭常曰：“天下者，乃吾兄之天下也。”于是司马昭受封晋王，欲立攸为世子。山涛谏曰：“废长立幼，违礼不祥。”贾充、何曾、裴秀亦谏曰：“长子聪明神武，有超世之才；人望既茂，天表如此：非人臣之相也。”昭犹豫未决\n######################\nOutput:"},
