魏兵阻其去路，密如铁桶。维奋死杀出，折兵大半，飞奔上阳平关来。前面又一军杀到；为首一员大将，纵马横刀而出。那人生得圆面大耳，方口厚唇，左目下生个黑瘤，瘤上生数十根黑毛，乃司马懿长子骠骑将军司马师也。维大怒曰：“孺子焉敢阻吾归路！”拍马挺枪，直来刺师。师挥刀相迎。只三合，杀败了司马师，维脱身径奔阳平关来。城上人开门放入姜维。司马师也来抢关，两边伏弩齐发，一弩发十矢，乃武侯临终时所遗连弩之法也。正是：难支此日三军败，独赖当年十矢传。未知司马师性命如何，且看下文分解。

　　却说姜维正走，遇着司马师引兵拦截。原来姜维取雍州之时，郭淮飞报入朝，魏主与司马懿商议停当，懿遣长子司马师引兵五万，前来雍州助战；师听知郭淮敌退蜀兵，师料蜀兵势弱，就来半路击之。直赶到阳平关，却被姜维用武侯所传连弩法，于两边暗伏连弩百余张，一弩发十矢，皆是药箭，两边弩箭齐发，前军连人带马射死不知其数。司马师于乱军之中，逃命而回。却说麴山城中蜀将句安，见援兵不至，乃开门降魏。姜维折兵数万，领败兵回汉中屯扎。司马师自还洛阳。至嘉平三年秋八月，司马懿染病，渐渐沉重，乃唤二子至榻前嘱曰：“吾事魏历年，官授太傅，人臣之位极矣；人皆疑吾有异志，吾尝怀恐惧。吾死之后，汝二人善理国政。慎之！慎之！”言讫而亡。长子司马师，次子司马昭，二人申奏魏主曹芳。芳厚加祭葬，优锡赠谥；封师为大将军，总领尚书机密大事，昭为骠骑上将军。却说吴主孙权，先有太子孙登，乃徐夫人所生，于吴赤乌四年身亡，遂立次子孙和为太子，乃琅琊王夫人所生。和因与全公主不睦，被公主所谮，权废之，和忧恨而死，又立三子孙亮为太子，乃潘夫人所生。此时陆逊、诸葛瑾皆亡，一应大小事务，皆归于诸葛恪。太元元年秋八月初一日，忽起大风，江海涌涛，平地水深八尺。吴主先陵所种松柏，尽皆拔起，直飞到建业城南门外，倒卓于道上。权因此受惊成病。至次年四月内，病势沉重，乃召太傅诸葛恪\n######################\nOutput:"},
