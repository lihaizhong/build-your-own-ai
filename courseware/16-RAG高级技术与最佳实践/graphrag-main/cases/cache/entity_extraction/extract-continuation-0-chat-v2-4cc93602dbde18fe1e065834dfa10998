 \n  \n  　　耀逃命而走，正遇山坡口一彪军，乃是姜维。耀大骂曰：“反贼无信！吾不幸误中汝奸计也！”维笑曰：“吾欲擒曹真，误赚汝矣！速下马受降！”耀骤马夺路，望山谷中而走。忽见谷口火光冲天，背后追兵又至。耀自刎身死，余众尽降。孔明连夜驱兵，直出祁山前下寨，收住军马，重赏姜维。维曰：“某恨不得杀曹真也！”孔明亦曰：“可惜大计小用矣。”  \n  \n  　　却说曹真听知折了费耀，悔之不及，遂与郭淮商议退兵之策。于是孙礼、辛毗星夜具表申奏魏主，言蜀兵又出祁山，曹真损兵折将，势甚危急。睿大惊，即召司马懿入内曰：“曹真损兵折将，蜀兵又出祁山。卿有何策，可以退之？”懿曰：“臣已有退诸葛亮之计。不用魏军扬武耀威，蜀兵自然走矣。”正是：已见子丹无胜术，全凭仲达有良谋。未知其计如何，且看下文分解。  \n  　　  \n\n正文
