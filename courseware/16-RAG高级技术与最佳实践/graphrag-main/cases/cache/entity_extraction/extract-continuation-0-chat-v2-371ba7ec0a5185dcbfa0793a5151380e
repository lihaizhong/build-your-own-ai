�谅与府官商议。多官曰：“若不去救，失了南安，送了夏侯驸马，皆我两郡之罪也：只得救之。”谅即点起人马，离城而去，只留文官守城。  \n  \n  　　崔谅提兵向南安大路进发，遥望见火光冲天，催兵星夜前进，离南安尚有五十余里，忽闻前后喊声大震，哨马报道：“前面关兴截住去路，背后张苞杀来！”安定之兵，四下逃窜。谅大惊，乃领手下百余人，往小路死战得脱，奔回安定。方到城壕边，城上乱箭射下来。蜀将魏延在城上叫曰：“吾已取了城也！何不早降？”原来魏延扮作安定军，夤夜赚开城门，蜀兵尽入，因此得了安定。  \n  \n  　　崔谅慌投天水郡来。行不到一程，前面一彪军摆开。大旗之下，一人纶巾羽扇，道袍鹤氅，端坐于车上。谅视之，乃孔明也，急拨回马走。关兴、张苞两路兵追到，只叫：“早降！”崔谅见四面皆是蜀兵，不得已遂降，同归大寨。孔明以上宾相待。孔明曰：“南安太守与足下交厚否？”谅曰：“此人乃杨阜之族弟杨陵也；与某邻郡，交契甚厚。”孔明曰：“今欲烦足下入城，说杨陵擒夏侯楙，可乎？”谅曰：“丞相若令某去，可暂退军马，容某入城说之。”孔明从其言，即时传令，教四面军马各退二十里下寨。崔谅匹马到城边叫开城门，入到府中，与杨陵礼毕，细言其事。陵曰：“我等受魏主大恩，安忍背之？可将计就计而行。”遂引崔谅到夏侯楙处，备细说知。楙曰：“当用何计？”杨陵曰：“只推某献城门，赚蜀兵入，却就城中杀之。”崔谅依计而行，出城见孔明，说：“杨陵献城门，放大军入城，以擒夏侯楙。杨陵本欲自捉，因手下勇士不多，未敢轻动。”孔明曰：“此事至易：今有足下原降兵百余人，于内暗藏蜀将扮作安定军马，带入城去、先伏于夏侯楙府下；却暗约杨陵，待半夜之时，献开城门，里应外合。”崔谅暗思：“若不带蜀将去，恐孔明生疑。且带入去，就内先斩之，举火为号，赚孔明入来，杀之可也。”因此应允。孔明嘱曰：“吾遣亲信将关兴、张苞随足下先去，只推救军杀入城中，以安夏侯楙之心；但举火，吾当亲入城去擒之。”时值黄昏，关兴、张苞受了孔明密计，披挂上马，各执兵器，杂在安定军中，随崔谅来到南安城下。杨陵在城上撑起悬空板，倚定护心栏，问曰：“何处军马？”崔谅曰：“安定救军来\n######################\nOutput:"},
