�晃领兵追至蜀寨，天色已暮；见寨中偃旗息鼓，又见赵云匹马单枪，立于营外，寨门大开，二将不敢前进。正疑之间，曹操亲到，急催督众军向前。众军听令，大喊一声，杀奔营前；见赵云全然不动，曹兵翻身就回。赵云把枪一招，壕中弓弩齐发。时天色昏黑，正不知蜀兵多少。操先拨回马走。只听得后面喊声大震，鼓角齐鸣，蜀兵赶来。曹兵自相践踏，拥到汉水河边，落水死者，不知其数。赵云、黄忠、张著各引兵一枝，追杀甚急。操正奔走间，忽刘封、孟达率二枝兵，从米仓山路杀来，放火烧粮草。操弃了北山粮草，忙回南郑。徐晃、张郃扎脚不住，亦弃本寨而走。赵云占了曹寨，黄忠夺了粮草，汉水所得军器无数，大获胜捷，差人去报玄德。玄德遂同孔明前至汉水，问赵云的部卒曰：“子龙如何厮杀？”军士将子龙救黄忠、拒汉水之事，细述一遍。玄德大喜，看了山前山后险峻之路，欣然谓孔明曰：“子龙一身都是胆也！”后人有诗赞曰：“昔日战长坂，威风犹未减。突阵显英雄，被围施勇敢。鬼哭与神号，天惊并地惨。常山赵子龙，一身都是胆！”于是玄德号子龙为虎威将军，大劳将士，欢宴至晚。忽报曹操复遣大军从斜谷小路而进，来取汉水。玄德笑曰：“操此来无能为也。我料必得汉水矣。”乃率兵于汉水之西以迎之。曹操命徐晃为先锋，前来决战。帐前一人出曰：“某深知地理，愿助徐将军同去破蜀。”操视之，乃巴西宕渠人也，姓王，名平，字子均；现充牙门将军。操大喜，遂命王平为副先锋，相助徐晃。操屯兵于定军山北。徐晃、王平引军至汉水，晃令前军渡水列阵。平曰：“军若渡水，倘要急退，如之奈何？”晃曰：“昔韩信背水为阵，所谓致之死地而后生也。”平曰：“不然。昔者韩信料敌人无谋而用此计；今将军能料赵云、黄忠之意否？”晃曰：“汝可引步军拒敌，看我引马军破之。”遂令搭起浮桥，随即过河来战蜀兵。正是：魏人妄意宗韩信，蜀相那知是子房。未知胜负如何，且看下文分解。
