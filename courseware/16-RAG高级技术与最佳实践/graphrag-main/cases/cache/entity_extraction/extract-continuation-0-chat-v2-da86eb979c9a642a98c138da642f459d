，迎接入城。至公廨礼毕，云长问曰：“汉中王封我何爵？”诗曰：“五虎大将之首。”云长问：“那五虎将？”诗曰：“关、张、赵、马、黄是也。”云长怒曰：“翼德吾弟也；孟起世代名家；子龙久随吾兄，即吾弟也：位与吾相并，可也。黄忠何等人，敢与吾同列？大丈夫终不与老卒为伍？”遂不肯受印。诗笑曰：“将军差矣。昔萧何、曹参与高祖同举大事，最为亲近，而韩信乃楚之亡将也；然信位为王，居萧、曹之上，未闻萧、曹以此为怨。今汉中王虽有五虎将之封，而与将军有兄弟之义，视同一体。将军即汉中王，汉中王即将军也。岂与诸人等哉？将军受汉中王厚恩，当与同休戚、共祸福，不宜计较官号之高下。愿将军熟思之。”云长大悟，乃再拜曰：“某之不明，非足下见教，几误大事。”即拜受印绶。  \n  \n  　　费诗方出王旨，令云长领兵取樊城。云长领命，即时便差傅士仁、糜芳二人为先锋，先引一军于荆州城外屯扎；一面设宴城中，款待费诗。饮至二更，忽报城外寨中火起。云长急披挂上马，出城看时，乃是傅士仁、糜芳饮酒，帐后遗火，烧着火炮，满营撼动，把军器粮草，尽皆烧毁。云长引兵救扑，至四更方才火灭。云长入城，召傅士仁、糜芳责之曰：“吾令汝二人作先锋，不曾出师，先将许多军器粮草烧毁，火炮打死本部军人。如此误事，要你二人何用？”叱令斩之。费诗告曰：“未曾出师，先斩大将，于军不利。可暂免其罪。”云长怒气不息，叱二人曰：“吾不看费司马之面，必斩汝二人之首！”乃唤武士各杖四十，摘去先锋印绶，罚糜芳守南郡，傅士仁守公安；且曰：“若吾得胜回来之日，稍有差池，二罪俱罚！”二人满面羞惭，喏喏而去。

　　且说关公是日祭了“帅”字大旗，假寐于帐中。忽见一猪，其大如牛，浑身黑色，奔入帐中，径咬云长之足。云长大怒，急拔剑斩之，声如裂帛。霎然惊觉，乃是一梦。便觉左足阴阴疼痛，心中大疑。唤关平\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>云长<|>PERSON<|>云长, also
