太子右弼。又以顾雍为丞相，陆逊为上将军，辅太子守武昌。权复还建业。群臣共议伐魏之策。张昭奏曰：“陛下初登宝位，未可动兵。只宜修文偃武，增设学校，以安民心；遣使入川，与蜀同盟，共分天下，缓缓图之。”权从其言，即令使命星夜入川，来见后主。礼毕，细奏其事。后主闻知，遂与群臣商议。众议皆谓孙权僭逆，宜绝其盟好。蒋琬曰：“可令人问于丞相。”后主即遣使到汉中问孔明。孔明曰：“可令人赍礼物入吴作贺，乞遣陆逊兴师伐魏。魏必命司马懿拒之。懿若南拒东吴，我再出祁山，长安可图也。”后主依言，遂令太尉陈震，将名马、玉带、金珠、宝贝，入吴作贺。  \n  \n  　　震至东吴，见了孙权，呈上国书。权大喜，设宴相待，打发回蜀。权召陆逊入，告以西蜀约会兴兵伐魏之事。逊曰：“此乃孔明惧司马懿之谋也。既与同盟，不得不从。今却虚作起兵之势，遥与西蜀为应。待孔明攻魏急，吾可乘虚取中原也。”即时下令，教荆襄各处都要训练人马，择日兴师。  \n  \n  　　却说陈震回到汉中，报知孔明。孔明尚忧陈仓不可轻进，先令人去哨探。回报说：“陈仓城中郝昭病重。”孔明曰：“大事成矣。”遂唤魏延、姜维分付曰：“汝二人领五千兵，星夜直奔陈仓城下；如见火起，并力攻城。”二人俱未深信，又来告曰：“何日可行？”孔明曰：“三日都要完备；不须辞我，即便起行。”二人受计去了。又唤关兴、张苞至，附耳低言，如此如此。二人各受密计而去。且说郭淮闻郝昭病重，乃与张郃商议曰：“郝昭病重，你可速去替他。我自写表申奏朝廷，别行定夺。”张郃引着三千兵，急来替郝昭。时郝昭病危，当夜正呻吟之间，忽报蜀军到城下了。昭急令人上城守把。时各门上火起，城中大乱。昭听知惊死。蜀兵一拥入城。  \n  \n  　　却说魏延、姜维领兵到陈仓城下看时，并不见一面旗号，又无打更之人。二人惊疑，不敢攻城。忽听得城上一声炮响，四面旗帜齐竖。只见一人纶巾羽扇，鹤氅道袍，大叫曰：“汝二人来的迟了！”二人视之，乃孔明也。二人慌忙下马，拜伏于地曰：“丞相真神计也！”孔明令放入城，谓二人曰：“吾打探得郝昭病重，吾令汝三日内领兵取城，此乃稳众人之心也。吾却令关兴、张苞，只推点军，暗出汉中。�\n######################\nOutput:"},
