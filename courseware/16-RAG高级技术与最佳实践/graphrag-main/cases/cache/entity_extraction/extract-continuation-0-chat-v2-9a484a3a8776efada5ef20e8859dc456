却说败残蛮兵有千余人，大半中伤而逃，正遇蛮王孟获。获收了败兵，心中稍喜，却与带来洞主商议曰：“吾今洞府已被蜀兵所占，今投何地安身？”带来洞主曰：“止有一国可以破蜀。”获喜曰：“何处可去？”带来洞主曰：“此去东南七百里，有一国，名乌戈国。国主兀突骨，身长丈二，不食五谷，以生蛇恶兽为饭；身有鳞甲，刀箭不能侵。其手下军士，俱穿藤甲；其藤生于山涧之中，盘于石壁之上；国人采取，浸于油中，半年方取出晒之；晒干复浸，凡十余遍，却才造成铠甲；穿在身上，渡江不沉，经水不湿，刀箭皆不能入：因此号为藤甲军。今大王可往求之。若得彼相助，擒诸葛亮如利刀破竹也。”孟获大喜，遂投乌戈国，来见兀突骨。其洞无宇舍，皆居土穴之内。孟获入洞，再拜哀告前事。兀突骨曰：“吾起本洞之兵，与汝报仇。”获欣然拜谢。于是兀突骨唤两个领兵俘长：一名土安，一名奚泥，起三万兵，皆穿藤甲，离乌戈国望东北而来。行至一江，名桃花水，两岸有桃树，历年落叶于水中，若别国人饮之尽死，惟乌戈国人饮之，倍添精神。兀突骨兵至桃花渡口下寨，以待蜀兵。  \n  \n  　　却说孔明令蛮人哨探孟获消息，回报曰：“孟获请乌戈国主，引三万藤甲军，现屯于桃花渡口。孟获又在各番聚集蛮兵，并力拒战。”孔明听说，提兵大进，直至桃花渡口。隔岸望见蛮兵，不类人形，甚是丑恶；又问土人，言说即日桃叶正落，水不可饮。孔明退五里下寨，留魏延守寨。  \n  \n  　　次日，乌戈国主引一彪藤甲军过河来，金鼓大震。魏延引兵出迎。蛮兵卷地而至。蜀兵以弩箭射到藤甲之上，皆不能透，俱落于地；刀砍枪刺，亦不能入。蛮兵皆使利刀钢叉，蜀兵如何抵当，尽皆败走。蛮兵不赶而回。魏延复回，赶到桃花渡口，只见蛮兵带甲渡水而去；内有困乏者，将甲脱下，放在水面，以身坐其上而渡。魏延急回大寨，来禀孔明，细言其事。孔明请吕凯并土人问之。凯曰：“某素闻南蛮中有一乌戈国，无人伦者也。更有藤甲护身，急切难伤。又有桃叶恶水，本国人饮之，反添精神；别国人饮之即死：如此蛮方，纵使全胜，有何益焉？不如�\n######################\nOutput:"},
