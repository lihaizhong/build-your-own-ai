　　过了两日，乡民奔告曰：“蜀兵退入谷中之时，哀声震地，军中扬起白旗：孔明果然死了，止留姜维引一千兵断后。前日车上之孔明，乃木人也。”懿叹曰：“吾能料其生，不能料其死也！”因此蜀中人谚曰：“死诸葛能走生仲达。”后人有诗叹曰：“长星半夜落天枢，奔走还疑亮未殂。关外至今人冷笑，头颅犹问有和无！”司马懿知孔明死信已确，乃复引兵追赶。行到赤岸坡，见蜀兵已去远，乃引还，顾谓众将曰：“孔明已死，我等皆高枕无忧矣！”遂班师回。一路上见孔明安营下寨之处，前后左右，整整有法，懿叹曰：“此天下奇才也！”于是引兵回长安，分调众将，各守隘口，懿自回洛阳面君去了。  \n  \n  　　却说杨仪、姜维排成阵势，缓缓退入栈阁道口，然后更衣发丧，扬幡举哀。蜀军皆撞跌而哭，至有哭死者。蜀兵前队正回到栈阁道口，忽见前面火光冲天，喊声震地，一彪军拦路。众将大惊，急报杨仪。正是：已见魏营诸将去，不知蜀地甚兵来。未知来者是何处军马，且看下文分解。  \n  　　  \n\n正文 第一百五回　武侯预伏锦囊计　魏主拆取承露盘 \n  \n  \n
