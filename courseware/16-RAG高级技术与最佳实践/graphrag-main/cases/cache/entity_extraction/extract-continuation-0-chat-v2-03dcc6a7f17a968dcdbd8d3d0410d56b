独司马懿奇其才，遂令参赞军机。艾为人口吃，每奏事必称艾艾。懿戏谓曰：卿称艾艾，当有几艾？艾应声曰：凤兮凤兮，故是一凤。其资性敏捷，大抵如此。此二人深可畏也。”维笑曰：“量此孺子，何足道哉！”  \n  \n  　　于是姜维引夏侯霸至成都，入见后主。维奏曰：“司马懿谋杀曹爽，又来赚夏侯霸，霸因此投降。目今司马懿父子专权，曹芳懦弱，魏国将危。臣在汉中有年，兵精粮足；臣愿领王师，即以霸为向导官，克服中原，重兴汉室：以报陛下之恩，以终丞相之志。”尚书令费祎谏曰：“近者，蒋琬、董允皆相继而亡，内治无人。伯约只宜待时，不宜轻动。”维曰：“不然。人生如白驹过隙，似此迁延岁月，何日恢复中原乎？”祎又曰：“孙子云：知彼知己，百战百胜。我等皆不如丞相远甚，丞相尚不能恢复中原，何况我等？”维曰：“吾久居陇上，深知羌人之心；今若结羌人为援，虽未能克复中原，自陇而西，可断而有也。”后主曰：“卿既欲伐魏，可尽忠竭力，勿堕锐气，以负朕命。”于是姜维领敕辞朝，同夏侯霸径到汉中，计议起兵。维曰：“可先遣使去羌人处通盟，然后出西平，近雍州。先筑二城于麴山之下，令兵守之，以为掎角之势。我等尽发粮草于川口，依丞相旧制，次第进兵。”
