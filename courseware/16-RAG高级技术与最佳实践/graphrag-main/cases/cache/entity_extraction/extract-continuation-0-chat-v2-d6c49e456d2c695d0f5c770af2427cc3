于荥阳，大败而回。绍令人接至寨中，会众置酒，与操解闷。饮宴间，操叹曰：“吾始兴大义，为国除贼。诸公既仗义而来，操之初意，欲烦本初引河内之众，临孟津、酸枣；诸将固守成皋，据敖仓，塞轘辕、太谷，制其险要；公路率南阳之军，驻丹、析，入武关，以震三辅。皆深沟高垒，勿与战，益为疑兵，示天下形势。以顺诛逆，可立定也。今迟疑不进，大失天下之望。操窃耻之！”绍等无言可对。既而席散，操见绍等各怀异心，料不能成事，自引军投扬州去了。公孙瓒谓玄德、关、张曰：“袁绍无能为也，久必有变。吾等且归。”遂拔寨北行。至平原，令玄德为平原相，自去守地养军。兖州太守刘岱，问东郡太守乔瑁借粮。瑁推辞不与，岱引军突入瑁营，杀死乔瑁，尽降其众。袁绍见众人各自分散，就领兵拔寨，离洛阳，投关东去了。\n却说荆州刺史刘表，字景升，山阳高平人也，乃汉室宗亲；幼好结纳，与名士七人为友，时号“江夏八俊”。那七人：汝南陈翔，字仲麟；同郡范滂，字孟博；鲁国孔昱，字世元；渤海范康，字仲真，山阳檀敷，字文友；同郡张俭，字元节；南阳岑咥，字公孝。刘表与此七人为友；有延平人蒯良、蒯越，襄阳人蔡瑁为辅。当时看了袁绍书，随令蒯越、蔡瑁引兵一万来截孙坚。坚军方到，蒯越将阵摆开，当先出马。孙坚问曰：“蒯异度何故引兵截吾去路？”越曰：“汝既为汉臣，如何私匿传国之宝？可速留下，放汝归去！”坚大怒，命黄盖出战。蔡瑁舞刀来迎。斗到数合，盖挥鞭打瑁正中护心镜。瑁拨回马走，孙坚乘势杀过界口。山背后金鼓齐鸣、乃刘表亲自引军来到。孙坚就马上施礼曰：“景升何故信袁绍之书，相逼邻郡？”表曰：“汝匿传国玺，将欲反耶？”坚曰：“吾若有此物，死于刀箭之下！”表曰：“汝若要我听信，将随军行李，任我搜看。”坚怒曰：“汝有何力，敢小觑我！”方欲交兵，刘表便退。坚纵马赶去，两山后伏兵齐起，背后蔡瑁、蒯越赶来，将孙坚困在垓心。正是：玉玺得来无用处，反因此宝动刀兵。毕竟孙坚怎地脱身，且听下文分解。
