　　司马懿不知是人是鬼，又不知多少蜀兵，十分惊惧，急急引兵奔入上邽，闭门不出。此时孔明早令三万精兵将陇上小麦割尽，运赴卤城打晒去了。司马懿在上邽城中，三日不敢出城。后见蜀兵退去，方敢令军出哨；于路捉得一蜀兵，来见司马懿。懿问之，其人告曰：“某乃割麦之人，因走失马匹，被捉前来。”懿曰：“前者是何神兵？答曰：“三路伏兵，皆不是孔明，乃姜维、马岱、魏延也。每一路只有一千军护车，五百军擂鼓。只是先来诱阵的车上乃孔明也。”懿仰天长叹曰：“孔明有神出鬼没之机！”忽报副都督郭淮入见。懿接入，礼毕，淮曰：“吾闻蜀兵不多，现在卤城打麦，可以击之。”懿细言前事。淮笑曰：“只瞒过一时，今已识破，何足道哉！吾引一军攻其后，公引一军攻其前，卤城可破，孔明可擒类。”懿从之，遂分兵两路而来。  \n  \n  　　却说孔明引军在卤城打晒小麦，忽唤诸将听今曰：“今夜敌人必来攻城。吾料卤城东西麦田之内，足可伏兵；谁敢为我一往？”姜维、魏延、马忠、马岱四将出曰：“某等愿往。”孔明大喜，乃命姜维、魏延各引二千兵，伏在东南、西北两处；马岱、马忠各引二千兵，伏在西南、东北两处：“只听炮响，四角一齐杀来。”四将受计，引兵去了。孔明自引百余人，各带火炮出城，伏在麦田之内等候。  \n  \n  　　却说司马懿引兵径到卤城下，日已昏黑，乃谓诸将曰：“若白日进兵，城中必有准备；今可乘夜晚攻之。此处城低壕浅，可便打破。”遂屯兵城外。一更时分，郭淮亦引兵到。两下合兵，一声鼓响，把卤城围得铁桶相似。城上万弩齐发，矢石如雨，魏兵不敢前进。忽然魏军中信炮连声，三军大惊，又不知何处兵来。淮令人去麦�\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role":
