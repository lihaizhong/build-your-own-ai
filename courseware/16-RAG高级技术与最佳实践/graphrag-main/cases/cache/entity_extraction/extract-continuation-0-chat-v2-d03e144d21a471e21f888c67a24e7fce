山僻去处，只等黄忠军到，却来放火，柴草堆上，一齐点着，烈焰飞腾，照耀山峪。严颜既斩夏侯德，从山后杀来。张郃、夏侯尚前后不能相顾，只得弃天荡山，望定军山投奔夏侯渊去了。\n黄忠、严颜守住天荡山，捷音飞报成都。玄德闻之，聚众将庆喜。法正曰：“昔曹操降张鲁，定汉中，不因此势以图巴、蜀，乃留夏侯渊、张郃二将屯守，而自引大军北还：此失计也。今张郃新败，天荡失守，主公若乘此时，举大兵亲往征之，汉中可定也。既定汉中，然后练兵积粟，观衅伺隙，进可讨贼，退可自守。此天与之时，不可失也。”玄德、孔明皆深然之。遂传令赵云、张飞为先锋，玄德与孔明亲自引兵十万，择日图汉中；传檄各处，严加提备。时建安二十三年秋七月吉日。玄德大军出葭萌关下营，召黄忠、严颜到寨，厚赏之。玄德曰：“人皆言将军老矣，惟军师独知将军之能。今果立奇功。但今汉中定军山，乃南郑保障，粮草积聚之所；若得定军山，阳平一路，无足忧矣。将军还敢取定军山否？黄忠慨然应诺，便要领兵前去。孔明急止之曰：“老将军虽然英勇，然夏侯渊非张郃之比也。渊深通韬略，善晓兵机，曹操倚之为西凉藩蔽：先曾屯兵长安，拒马孟起；今又屯兵汉中。操不托他人，而独托渊者，以渊有将才也。今将军虽胜张郃，未卜能胜夏侯渊。吾欲酌量着一人去荆州，替回关将军来，方可敌之。”忠奋然答曰：“昔廉颇年八十，尚食斗米、肉十斤，诸侯畏其勇，不敢侵犯赵界，何况黄忠未及七十乎？军师言吾老，吾今并不用副将，只将本部兵三千人去，立斩夏侯渊首级，纳于麾下。”孔明再三不容。黄忠只是要去。孔明曰：“既将军要去，吾使一人为监军同去，若何？”正是：请将须行激将法，少年不若老年人。未知其人是谁，且看下文分解。
