孙权威震江东，深得民心。且说陈震回见袁绍，具说：“孙策已亡，孙权继立。曹操封之为将军，结为外应矣。”袁绍大怒，遂起冀、青、幽、并等处人马七十余万，复来攻取许昌。正是：江南兵革方休息，冀北干戈又复兴。未知胜负若何，且听下文分解。  \n\n正文 第三十回 战官渡本初败绩 劫乌巢孟德烧粮\n\n却说袁绍兴兵，望官渡进发。夏侯惇发书告急。曹操起军七万，前往迎敌，留荀彧守许都。绍兵临发，田丰从狱中上书谏曰：“今且宜静守以待天时，不可妄兴大兵，恐有不利。”逢纪谮曰：“主公兴仁义之师，田丰何得出此不祥之语！”绍因怒，欲斩田丰。众官告免。绍恨曰：“待吾破了曹操，明正其罪！”遂催军进发，旌旗遍野，刀剑如林。行至阳武，下定寨栅。沮授曰：“我军虽众，而勇猛不及彼军；彼军虽精，而粮草不如我军。彼军无粮，利在急战；我军有粮，宜且缓守。若能旷以日月，则彼军不战自败矣。”绍怒曰：“田丰慢我军心，吾回日必斩之。汝安敢又如此！”叱左右：“将沮授锁禁军中，待我破曹之后，与田丰一体治罪！”于是下令，将大军七十万，东西南北，周围安营，连络九十余里。\n细作探知虚实，报至官渡。曹军新到，闻之皆惧。曹操与众谋士商议。荀攸曰：“绍军虽多，不足惧也。我军俱精锐之士，无不一以当十。但利在急战。若迁延日月，粮草不敷，事可忧矣。”操曰：“所言正合吾意。”遂传令军将鼓噪而进。绍军来迎，两边排成阵势。审配拨弩手一万，伏于两翼；弓箭手五千，伏于门旗内：约炮响齐发。三通鼓罢，袁绍金盔金甲，锦袍玉带，立马阵前。左右排列着张郃、高览、韩猛、淳于琼等诸将。旌旗节钺，甚是严整。曹阵上门旗开处，曹操出马。许诸、张辽、徐晃、李典等，各持兵器，前后拥卫。曹操以鞭指袁绍曰：“吾于天子之前，保奏你为大将军，今何故谋反？”绍怒曰：“汝托名汉相，实为汉贼！罪恶弥天，甚于莽、卓，乃反诬人造反耶！”操曰：“吾今奉诏讨汝！”绍曰：“吾奉衣带诏讨贼！”操怒，使张辽出战。张邰跃马来迎。二将斗了四五十合，不分胜负。曹操见了，暗暗称奇。许褚挥刀纵马，直出助战。\n######################\nOutput:"},
