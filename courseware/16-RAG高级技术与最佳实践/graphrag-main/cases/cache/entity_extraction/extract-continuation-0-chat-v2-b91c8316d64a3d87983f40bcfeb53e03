福，以致四方大乱！若非魏王在朝，弑陛下者，何止一人？陛下尚不知恩报德，直欲令天下人共伐陛下耶？”帝大惊，拂袖而起，王朗以目视华歆。歆纵步向前，扯住龙袍，变色而言曰：“许与不许，早发一言！”帝战栗不能答，曹洪、曹休拔剑大呼曰：“符宝郎何在？”祖弼应声出曰：“符宝郎在此！”曹洪索要玉玺。祖弼叱曰：“玉玺乃天子之宝，安得擅索！”洪喝令武士推出斩之。祖弼大骂不绝口而死。后人有诗赞曰：“奸宄专权汉室亡，诈称禅位效虞唐。满朝百辟皆尊魏，仅见忠臣符宝郎。”  \n  \n  　　帝颤栗不已。只见阶下披甲持戈数百余人，皆是魏兵。帝泣谓群臣曰：“朕愿将天下禅于魏王，幸留残喘，以终天年。”贾诩曰：“魏王必不负陛下。陛下可急降诏，以安众心。”帝只得令陈群草禅国之诏，令华歆赍捧诏玺，引百官直至魏王宫献纳。曹丕大喜。开读诏曰：“朕在位三十二年，遭天下荡覆，幸赖祖宗之灵，危而复存。然今仰瞻天象，俯察民心，炎精之数既终，行运在乎曹氏。是以前王既树神武之迹，今王又光耀明德，以应其期。历数昭明，信可知矣。夫大道之行，天下为公；唐尧不私于厥子，而名播于无穷，朕窃慕焉，今其追踵尧典，禅位于丞相魏王。王其毋辞！”  \n  \n  　　曹丕听毕，便欲受诏。司马懿谏曰：“不可。虽然诏玺已至，殿下宜且上表谦辞，以绝天下之谤。”丕从之，令王朗作表，自称德薄，请别求大贤以嗣天位。帝览表，心甚惊疑，谓群臣曰：“魏王谦逊，如之奈何？”华歆曰：“昔魏武王受王爵之时，三辞而诏不许，然后受之，今陛下可再降诏，魏王自当允从。”帝不得已，又令桓阶草诏，遣高庙使张音，持节奉玺至魏王宫。曹丕开读诏曰：“咨尔魏王，上书谦让。朕窃为汉道陵迟，为日已久；幸赖武王操，德膺符运，奋扬神武，芟除凶暴，清定区夏。今王丕缵承前绪，至德光昭，声教被四海，仁风扇八区；天之历数，实在尔躬。昔虞舜有大功二十，而放勋禅以天下；大禹有疏导之绩，而重华禅以帝位。汉承尧运，有传圣之义，加顺灵袛，绍天明命，使行御史大夫张音，持节奉皇帝玺绶。王其受之！”
