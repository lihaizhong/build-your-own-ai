曹操已得东川，主簿司马懿进曰：“刘备以诈力取刘璋，蜀人尚未归心。今主公已得汉中，益州震动。可速进兵攻之，势必瓦解。智者贵于乘时，时不可失也。”曹操叹曰：人苦不知足，既得陇，复望蜀耶？”刘晔曰：“司马仲达之言是也。若少迟缓，诸葛亮明于治国而为相，关、张等勇冠三军而为将，蜀民既定，据守关隘，不可犯矣。”操曰：“士卒远涉劳苦，且宜存恤。”遂按兵不动。却说西川百姓，听知曹操已取东川，料必来取西川，一日之间，数遍惊恐。玄德请军师商议。孔明曰：“亮有一计。曹操自退。”玄德问何计。孔明曰：“曹操分军屯合淝，惧孙权也。今我若分江夏、长沙、桂阳三郡还吴，遣舌辩之士，陈说利害，令吴起兵袭合淝，牵动其势，操必勒兵南向矣。”玄德问：“谁可为使？”伊籍曰：“某愿往。”玄德大喜，遂作书具礼，令伊籍先到荆州，知会云长，然后入吴。\n到秣陵，来见孙权，先通了姓名。权召籍入。籍见权礼毕，权问曰：“汝到此何为？”籍曰：“昨承诸葛子瑜取长沙等三郡，为军师不在，有失交割，今传书送还。所有荆州南郡、零陵，本欲送还；被曹操袭取东川，使关将军无容身之地。今合淝空虚，望君侯起兵攻之，使曹操撤兵回南。吾主若取了东川，即还荆州全土。”权曰：“汝且归馆舍，容吾商议。”伊籍退出，权问计于众谋士。张昭曰：“此是刘备恐曹操取西川，故为此谋。虽然如此，可因操在汉中。乘势取合淝，亦是上计。”权从之，发付伊籍回蜀去讫，便议起兵攻操：令鲁肃收取长沙、江夏、桂阳三郡，屯兵于陆口，取吕蒙、甘宁回；又去余杭取凌统回。不一日，吕蒙、甘宁先到。蒙献策曰：“现今曹操令庐江太守朱光，屯兵于皖城，大开稻田，纳谷于合淝，以充军实。今可先取皖城，然后攻合淝。”权曰：“此计甚合吾意。”遂教吕蒙、甘宁为先锋，蒋钦、潘璋为合后，权自引周泰、陈武、董袭、徐盛为中军。时程普、黄盖、韩当在各处镇守，都未随征。却说军马渡江，取和州，径到皖城。皖城太守朱光，使人往合淝求救；一面固守城池，坚壁不出。权自到城下看时，城上箭如雨发，射中孙权麾盖。权回寨，问众将曰：“如何取得皖城？”董袭曰：“可差军士筑起土山攻之。”徐�\n######################\nOutput:"},
